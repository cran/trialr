abstract = {PURPOSE: AUY922 is a potent non-geldanamycin inhibitor of heat-shock protein 90. This study was carried out in Japanese patients to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and to characterize safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single-agent AUY922. METHODS: Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors whose disease had progressed on at least one line of standard therapy, or for whom no standard therapy existed, were treated with AUY922 (intravenous, once-weekly, 28-day cycle, starting dose 8 mg/m(2)). RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were treated. Two DLTs were reported in one patient of the 54 mg/m(2) cohort; fatigue and decreased appetite (both Grade 3, resolving to Grade 1 within 8 days). No MTD was determined, and the dose recommended for Phase II studies was determined to be 70 mg/m(2) once-weekly. Most common drug-related toxicities were diarrhea, night blindness and nausea. Grade 1 and 2 visual toxicities at high AUY922 doses {\textgreater}/=22 mg/m(2) were observed. Ten patients (32 {\%}) achieved a best overall response of stable disease, and one patient (3 {\%}) achieved a confirmed partial response. CONCLUSION: Overall, AUY922 exhibited acceptable toxicities and demonstrated potential clinical activity in Japanese patients, with similar safety and pharmacokinetic profiles to those reported in a preceding global Phase I study in Western patients (CAUY922A2101).},

abstract = {Background Despite recent advances in the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, there remains a need for effective treatments for progressive disease. We assessed the efficacy of pembrolizumab for patients with previously treated, PD-L1-positive, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Methods We did this randomised, open-label, phase 2/3 study at 202 academic medical centres in 24 countries. Patients with previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer with PD-L1 expression on at least 1{\%} of tumour cells were randomly assigned (1:1:1) in blocks of six per stratum with an interactive voice-response system to receive pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. The primary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival both in the total population and in patients with PD-L1 expression on at least 50{\%} of tumour cells. We used a threshold for significance of p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}00825 (one-sided) for the analysis of overall survival and a threshold of p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}001 for progression-free survival. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01905657. Findings Between Aug 28, 2013, and Feb 27, 2015, we enrolled 1034 patients: 345 allocated to pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 346 allocated to pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 343 allocated to docetaxel. By Sept 30, 2015, 521 patients had died. In the total population, median overall survival was 10{\textperiodcentered}4 months with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 12{\textperiodcentered}7 months with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 8{\textperiodcentered}5 months with docetaxel. Overall survival was significantly longer for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg versus docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR] 0{\textperiodcentered}71, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}58-0{\textperiodcentered}88; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0008) and for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg versus docetaxel (0{\textperiodcentered}61, 0{\textperiodcentered}49-0{\textperiodcentered}75; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Median progression-free survival was 3{\textperiodcentered}9 months with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 4{\textperiodcentered}0 months with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 4{\textperiodcentered}0 months with docetaxel, with no significant difference for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg versus docetaxel (0{\textperiodcentered}88, 0{\textperiodcentered}74-1{\textperiodcentered}05; p=0{\textperiodcentered}07) or for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg versus docetaxel (HR 0{\textperiodcentered}79, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}66-0{\textperiodcentered}94; p=0{\textperiodcentered}004). Among patients with at least 50{\%} of tumour cells expressing PD-L1, overall survival was significantly longer with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg than with docetaxel (median 14{\textperiodcentered}9 months vs 8{\textperiodcentered}2 months; HR 0{\textperiodcentered}54, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}38-0{\textperiodcentered}77; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0002) and with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg than with docetaxel (17{\textperiodcentered}3 months vs 8{\textperiodcentered}2 months; 0{\textperiodcentered}50, 0{\textperiodcentered}36-0{\textperiodcentered}70; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Likewise, for this patient population, progression-free survival was significantly longer with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg than with docetaxel (median 5{\textperiodcentered}0 months vs 4{\textperiodcentered}1 months; HR 0{\textperiodcentered}59, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}44-0{\textperiodcentered}78; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0001) and with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg than with docetaxel (5{\textperiodcentered}2 months vs 4{\textperiodcentered}1 months; 0{\textperiodcentered}59, 0{\textperiodcentered}45-0{\textperiodcentered}78; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events were less common with pembrolizumab than with docetaxel (43 [13{\%}] of 339 patients given 2 mg/kg, 55 [16{\%}] of 343 given 10 mg/kg, and 109 [35{\%}] of 309 given docetaxel). Interpretation Pembrolizumab prolongs overall survival and has a favourable benefit-to-risk profile in patients with previously treated, PD-L1-positive, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. These data establish pembrolizumab as a new treatment option for this population and validate the use of PD-L1 selection.},

abstract = {SUMMARY Stratifying and matching by the propensity score are increasingly popular approaches to deal with confounding in medical studies investigating effects of a treatment or exposure. A more traditional alternative technique is the direct adjustment for confounding in regression models. This paper discusses fundamental differences between the two approaches, with a focus on linear regression and propensity score stratification, and identifies points to be considered for an adequate comparison. The treatment estimators are examined for unbiasedness and efficiency. This is illustrated in an application to real data and supplemented by an investigation on properties of the estimators for a range of underlying linear models. We demonstrate that in specific circumstances the propensity score estimator is identical to the effect estimated from a full linear model, even if it is built on coarser covariate strata than the linear model. As a consequence the coarsening property of the propensity score—adjustment for a one-dimensional confounder instead of a high-dimensional covariate—may be viewed as a way to implement a pre-specified, richly parametrized linear model. We conclude that the propensity score estimator inherits the potential for overfitting and that care should be taken to restrict covariates to those relevant for outcome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the paediatric population, pain and distress associated with burn injuries during wound care procedures remain a constant challenge. Although silver dressings are the gold standard for burn care in Australasia, very few high-level trials have been conducted that compare silver dressings to determine which will provide the best level of care clinically. Therefore, for paediatric patients in particular, identifying silver dressings that are associated with lower levels of pain and rapid wound re-epithelialisation is imperative. This study will determine whether there is a difference in time to re-epithelialisation and pain and distress experienced during wound care procedures among Acticoat™, Acticoat™ combined with Mepitel™ and Mepilex Ag™ dressings for acute, paediatric partial thickness burns.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS/DESIGN: Children aged 0 to 15 years with an acute partial thickness (superficial partial to deep partial thickness inclusive) burn injury and a burn total body surface area of ≤ 10{\%} will be eligible for the trial. Patients will be randomised to one of the three dressing groups: (1) Acticoat™ or (2) Acticoat™ combined with Mepitel™ or (3) Mepilex Ag™. A minimum of 28 participants will be recruited for each treatment group. Primary measures of pain, distress and healing will be repeated at each dressing change until complete wound re-epithelialisation occurs or skin grafting is required. Additional data collected will include infection status at each dressing change, physical function, scar outcome and scar management requirements, cost effectiveness of each dressing and staff perspectives of the dressings.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: The results of this study will determine the effects of three commonly used silver and silicone burn dressing combinations on the rate of wound re-epithelialisation and pain experienced during dressing procedures in acute, paediatric partial thickness burn injuries.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12613000105741.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frequently a biomarker capable of defining a patient population with enhanced response to an experimental agent is not fully validated with a known threshold at the start of a phase II trial. When such candidate predictive markers are evaluated and/or validated retrospectively, over-accrual of patients less likely to benefit from the regimen may result, leading to underpowered analyses or sub-optimal patient care.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPURPOSE: We propose an adaptive randomized phase II study design incorporating prospective biomarker threshold identification (or non-identification), possible early futility stopping, potential mid-trial accrual restriction to marker-positive subjects, and final marker and treatment evaluation in the patient population identified as most likely to benefit.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: An interim analysis is used to determine whether an initially unselected trial should stop early for futility, continue without a promising marker, or adapt accrual and resize (up to a pre-determined maximum) according to a promising biomarker. Final efficacy analyses are performed in the target population identified at the interim as most likely to benefit from the experimental regimen. Simulation studies demonstrate control of false-positive error rates, power, reduced average sample size, and other favorable aspects.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The design performs well at identifying a truly predictive biomarker at interim analysis, and subsequently restricting accrual to patients most likely to benefit from the experimental treatment. Type I and type II error rates are adequately controlled by restricting the range of marker prevalence via the candidate thresholds, and by careful consideration of the timing of interim analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In situations where identification and validation of a naturally continuous biomarker are desired within a randomized phase II trial, the design presented herein offers a potential solution.},

Over 8 million de-identified longitudinally collected data points from over 8,600 individuals with ALS were standardized across trials and merged to create the Pooled Resource Open-Access ALS Clinical Trials (PRO-ACT) database. This database includes demographics, family histories, and longitudinal clinical and laboratory data. Mixed effects models were used to describe the rate of disease progression measured by the Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) and vital capacity (VC). Cox regression models were used to describe survival data. Implementing Bonferroni correction, the critical p value for 15 different tests was p = 0.003.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The ALSFRS-R rate of decline was 1.02 (±2.3) points per month and the VC rate of decline was 2.24{\%} of predicted (±6.9) per month. Higher levels of uric acid at trial entry were predictive of a slower drop in ALSFRS-R (p = 0.01) and VC (p {\textless} 0.0001), and longer survival (p = 0.02). Higher levels of creatinine at baseline were predictive of a slower drop in ALSFRS-R (p = 0.01) and VC (p {\textless} 0.0001), and longer survival (p = 0.01). Finally, higher body mass index (BMI) at baseline was associated with longer survival (p {\textless} 0.0001).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The PRO-ACT database is the largest publicly available repository of merged ALS clinical trials data. We report that baseline levels of creatinine and uric acid, as well as baseline BMI, are strong predictors of disease progression and survival.},

abstract = {The 3 + 3 design is the most common choice among clinicians for phase I dose-escalation oncology trials. In recent reviews, more than 95{\%} of phase I trials have been based on the 3 + 3 design. Given that it is intuitive and its implementation does not require a computer program, clinicians can conduct 3 + 3 dose escalations in practice with virtually no logistic cost, and trial protocols based on the 3 + 3 design pass institutional review board and biostatistics reviews quickly. However, the performance of the 3 + 3 design has rarely been compared with model-based designs in simulation studies with matched sample sizes. In the vast majority of statistical literature, the 3 + 3 design has been shown to be inferior in identifying true maximum-tolerated doses (MTDs), although the sample size required by the 3 + 3 design is often orders-of-magnitude smaller than model-based designs. In this article, through comparative simulation studies with matched sample sizes, we demonstrate that the 3 + 3 design has higher risks of exposing patients to toxic doses above the MTD than the modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design, a newly developed adaptive method. In addition, compared with the mTPI design, the 3 + 3 design does not yield higher probabilities in identifying the correct MTD, even when the sample size is matched. Given that the mTPI design is equally transparent, costless to implement with free software, and more flexible in practical situations, we highly encourage its adoption in early dose-escalation studies whenever the 3 + 3 design is also considered. We provide free software to allow direct comparisons of the 3 + 3 design with other model-based designs in simulation studies with matched sample sizes.},

abstract = {Objective To improve the accuracy and completeness of reporting of studies of diagnostic accuracy, to allow readers to assess the potential for bias in a study, and to evaluate a study's generalisability. Methods The Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) steering committee searched the literature to identify publications on the appropriate conduct and reporting of diagnostic studies and extracted potential items into an extensive list. Researchers, editors, and members of professional organisations shortened this list during a two day consensus meeting, with the goal of developing a checklist and a generic flow diagram for studies of diagnostic accuracy. Results The search for published guidelines about diagnostic research yielded 33 previously published checklists, from which we extracted a list of 75 potential items. At the consensus meeting, participants shortened the list to a 25 item checklist, by using evidence, whenever available. A prototype of a flow diagram provides information about the method of patient recruitment, the order of test execution, and the numbers of patients undergoing the test under evaluation and the reference standard, or both. Conclusions Evaluation of research depends on complete and accurate reporting. If medical journals adopt the STARD checklist and flow diagram, the quality of reporting of studies of diagnostic accuracy should improve to the advantage of clinicians, researchers, reviewers, journals, and the public.},

abstract = {Background: Ibrutinib (IBR) is an oral BTK inhibitor with high response rates in CLL. Venetoclax (VEN) is a potent, highly selective, orally bioavailable smallmolecule BCL2 inhibitor. Both IBR and VEN are approved by both the FDA and EMA as single agents for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). IBR leads to a rapid nodal response with re-distribution of CLL into the peripheral blood whereas VEN leads to depletion of CLL cells to levels in some patients where they cannot be detected. Two of the key cellular processes that are abnormal in CLL are proliferation and apoptosis. The combination of IBR with VEN is therefore logical as biologically the two drugs would be expected to be synergistic. The eradication of minimal residual disease (MRD) from blood and bone marrow is associated with improved outcome in any treatment of CLL where it has been reported. Aims: The CLARITY trial (ISCRTN: 13751862) is a feasibility study to investigate the safety and efficacy of IBR combined with VEN in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. Here we report for the first time the safety of the combination as well as early signs of potent synergy. Methods: After 8 weeks of IBR monotherapy (420mg/day), VEN was added initially at a dose of 10mg/day with weekly escalations to 20mg, 50mg, 100mg, 200mg to a final dose of 400mg/day. After the initial 3 patients when there was no sign of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) the starting dose of VEN was amended to 20mg/day. The primary end-point of the trial is MRD eradication (defined as less than 1 CLL cell in 10, 000) in the bone marrow after 12 months of IBR+VEN. Key secondary end-points are MRD eradication from the bone marrow after 6 and 24 months of combined IBR and VEN as well as the safety of the combination. Important safety events that were considered critical were the incidence of laboratory and clinical TLS. All patients were given prophylactic treatment with uric acid reducing agents beginning at least 72 hours prior to their initial dose of VEN. Over the first three months of combined therapy the level of CLL in the peripheral blood was monitored weekly during VEN escalation and then monthly thereafter. 50 participants will be treated in total. Results: A total of 35 patients have been recruited between May 2016 and January 2017. To date 21 patients have completed the dose escalation period of VEN in combination with IBR. To date there has been only a single case of laboratory TLS in a patient whose phosphate (1.21 to 1.48mmol/l) and creatinine (75 to 146 umol/l) both increased when VEN was increased from 100mg to 200mg. Dosing of VEN was interrupted for 7 days (due to the logistics of clinic closure periods over the Christmas break) and IBR for 24 hours. The biochemical abnormalities resolved within 24 hours and the patient subsequently escalated to 400mg/day of VEN with no further TLS. As yet there have been a total of 5 SAEs and 22 AE's of special interest with notably lung infection (n=3) and neutropenia (n=11) occurring on more than one occasion. All SAE's resolved with appropriate management and all patients remained on therapy. No SUSAR's have been reported and no AE's have been fatal. The level of CLL in the peripheral blood increased during the 8 weeks of IBR monotherapy at 420mg/day from a median of 50 × 109/l (range: 0 to 330) to 55 × 109/l (range: 0 to 237) and then fell during the first 8 weeks of combined IBR with VEN (4 weeks dose escalation followed by 4 weeks at 400mg/day) from a median of 55 × 109/l to a median of 0.017 × 109/l (range; 0 to 3.1). The rate of fall is rapid in all patients with a median of 3 log reduction in CLL level after 8 weeks of combined therapy. Summary/Conclusions: The combination of IBR with VEN is well tolerated in relapsed, refractory CLL with to date only a single case of laboratory TLS. The rapid reduction in the peripheral blood CLL level even during the escalation phase of VEN with IBR is promising and suggests a potent synergy between the drugs. The initial bone marrow responses are expected after 6 months of combination therapy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In systematic reviews and meta-analyses, time-to-event outcomes are most appropriately analysed using hazard ratios (HRs). In the absence of individual patient data (IPD), methods are available to obtain HRs and/or associated statistics by carefully manipulating published or other summary data. Awareness and adoption of these methods is somewhat limited, perhaps because they are published in the statistical literature using statistical notation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: This paper aims to 'translate' the methods for estimating a HR and associated statistics from published time-to-event-analyses into less statistical and more practical guidance and provide a corresponding, easy-to-use calculations spreadsheet, to facilitate the computational aspects.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A wider audience should be able to understand published time-to-event data in individual trial reports and use it more appropriately in meta-analysis. When faced with particular circumstances, readers can refer to the relevant sections of the paper. The spreadsheet can be used to assist them in carrying out the calculations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The methods cannot circumvent the potential biases associated with relying on published data for systematic reviews and meta-analysis. However, this practical guide should improve the quality of the analysis and subsequent interpretation of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that include time-to-event outcomes.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Acetazolamide is commonly used to treat idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), but there is insufficient information to establish an evidence base for its use.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether acetazolamide is beneficial in improving vision when added to a low-sodium weight reduction diet in patients with IIH and mild visual loss.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study of acetazolamide in 165 participants with IIH and mild visual loss who received a low-sodium weight-reduction diet. Participants were enrolled at 38 academic and private practice sites in North America from March 2010 to November 2012 and followed up for 6 months (last visit in June 2013). All participants met the modified Dandy criteria for IIH and had a perimetric mean deviation (PMD) between -2 dB and -7 dB. The mean age was 29 years and all but 4 participants were women.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERVENTIONS: Low-sodium weight-reduction diet plus the maximally tolerated dosage of acetazolamide (up to 4 g/d) or matching placebo for 6 months.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The planned primary outcome variable was the change in PMD from baseline to month 6 in the most affected eye, as measured by Humphrey Field Analyzer. Perimetric mean deviation is a measure of global visual field loss (mean deviation from age-corrected normal values), with a range of 2 to -32 dB; larger negative values indicate greater vision loss. Secondary outcome variables included changes in papilledema grade, quality of life (Visual Function Questionnaire 25 [VFQ-25] and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey), headache disability, and weight at month 6.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The mean improvement in PMD was greater with acetazolamide (1.43 dB, from -3.53 dB at baseline to -2.10 dB at month 6; n = 86) than with placebo (0.71 dB, from -3.53 dB to -2.82 dB; n = 79); the difference was 0.71 dB (95{\%} CI, 0 to 1.43 dB; P = .050). Mean improvements in papilledema grade (acetazolamide: -1.31, from 2.76 to 1.45; placebo: -0.61, from 2.76 to 2.15; treatment effect, -0.70; 95{\%} CI, -0.99 to -0.41; P {\textless} .001) and vision-related quality of life as measured by the National Eye Institute VFQ-25 (acetazolamide: 8.33, from 82.97 to 91.30; placebo: 1.98, from 82.97 to 84.95; treatment effect, 6.35; 95{\%} CI, 2.22 to 10.47; P = .003) and its 10-item neuro-ophthalmic supplement (acetazolamide: 9.82, from 75.45 to 85.27; placebo: 1.59, from 75.45 to 77.04; treatment effect, 8.23; 95{\%} CI, 3.89 to 12.56; P {\textless} .001) were also observed with acetazolamide. Participants assigned to acetazolamide also experienced a reduction in weight (acetazolamide: -7.50 kg, from 107.72 kg to 100.22 kg; placebo: -3.45 kg, from 107.72 kg to 104.27 kg; treatment effect, -4.05 kg, 95{\%} CI, -6.27 to -1.83 kg; P {\textless} .001).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients with IIH and mild visual loss, the use of acetazolamide with a low-sodium weight-reduction diet compared with diet alone resulted in modest improvement in visual field function. The clinical importance of this improvement remains to be determined.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nTRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01003639.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND We assessed the efficacy and safety of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibition with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer enrolled in a phase 1 study. We also sought to define and validate an expression level of the PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) that is associated with the likelihood of clinical benefit. METHODS We assigned 495 patients receiving pembrolizumab (at a dose of either 2 mg or 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 3 weeks or 10 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks) to either a training group (182 patients) or a validation group (313 patients). We assessed PD-L1 expression in tumor samples using immunohistochemical analysis, with results reported as the percentage of neoplastic cells with staining for membranous PD-L1 (proportion score). Response was assessed every 9 weeks by central review. RESULTS Common side effects that were attributed to pembrolizumab were fatigue, pruritus, and decreased appetite, with no clear difference according to dose or schedule. Among all the patients, the objective response rate was 19.4{\%}, and the median duration of response was 12.5 months. The median duration of progression-free survival was 3.7 months, and the median duration of overall survival was 12.0 months. PD-L1 expression in at least 50{\%} of tumor cells was selected as the cutoff from the training group. Among patients with a proportion score of at least 50{\%} in the validation group, the response rate was 45.2{\%}. Among all the patients with a proportion score of at least 50{\%}, median progression-free survival was 6.3 months; median overall survival was not reached. CONCLUSIONS Pembrolizumab had an acceptable side-effect profile and showed antitumor activity in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. PD-L1 expression in at least 50{\%} of tumor cells correlated with improved efficacy of pembrolizumab. (Funded by Merck; KEYNOTE-001 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01295827.).},

abstract = {Aims: To evaluate the efficacy of 50{\%} autologous serum drops against conventional treatment in ocular surface disorders refractory to normal treatments in a prospective randomised crossover trial.  Method: Patients fulfilling ophthalmological and haematological entry criteria were randomised to either 3 months of autologous serum 50{\%} followed by 3 months of their conventional treatment, or 3 months of conventional treatment, followed by 3 months of autologous serum. Clinical assessments, including Schirmer's test, rose Bengal, and fluorescein staining, were carried out on entry and at monthly intervals. Impression cytology was performed at entry, 3 and 6 months. Grading was carried out on degrees of squamous metaplasia and goblet cell density. Subjective comfort was recorded daily using the "faces" scale. These categorical scores were converted to linear measurement using Rasch analysis. Statistical analysis was carried out using Wilcoxon's signed rank test and ANOVA.  Results: 16 patients were recruited with 31 eyes studied. The ocular surface diseases chiefly included Sjogren's syndrome (n = 6) and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (n = 5). Impression cytology available in 25 of 31 eyes showed significant improvement on serum treatment, p{\textless}0.02. Rasch weighted faces scores were statistically significantly better with serum, p{\textless}0.01.

abstract = {In this large-scale, multinational, descriptive survey, we sought to identify measures for improving treatment outcomes for individuals with epilepsy. As a framework, questions relating specifically to each of the five steps of the 'patient-physician journey', namely, patient identification (omitted in this survey), diagnosis, choice of drug, disease and drug information, and patient monitoring were asked. Overall, 337 physicians and 1150 patients across France, Germany, and the United States returned questionnaires. Results indicated that 16{\%} of the patients were initially misdiagnosed. Treatment choice was driven by efficacy, safety, experience with a drug (physician only), and convenience (patient only). Physicians were identified as the primary source of information for patients, and, as expected, better informed patients were found to adhere better to their therapy than those who were less well informed. Approximately 50{\%} of the patients had not seen their specialist in the last year, which indicates poor follow-up; furthermore, important topics such as seizures, treatment, and its side effects were not discussed at every visit. Specialists, but not primary care practitioners (PCPs), consistently reported discussing all topics more frequently than their patients, suggesting that specialists may overestimate the clarity of their questions. There was also substantial disparity in the reasons cited for nonadherence - patients overwhelmingly cited forgetfulness, while both PCPs and specialists cited complacency, forgetfulness, and tolerability. We also noted a disparity between physicians and their patients, as well as between PCPs and specialists, in their views on the impact of epilepsy on patients' lives. Our results indicate multiple opportunities to intervene at all stages of the patient-physician journey to improve treatment outcomes. We provide practical suggestions to achieve the most from these opportunities. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bayesian designs are increasingly used to conduct phase II clinical trials. However, stopping boundaries in most Bayesian designs are defined from posterior credible intervals. The use of designs based on posterior credible intervals results in a loss of efficiency when compared to formal stopping rules based on Bayesian hypothesis tests. Such designs also introduce an unnecessary element of subjectivity in the interpretation of trial results.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We derive a new class of Bayesian designs based on formal hypothesis tests. The prior densities used to define the alternative hypotheses in these tests assign no mass to parameter values that are consistent with the null hypotheses and are called nonlocal alternative prior densities.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We show that Bayesian designs based on hypothesis tests and nonlocal alternative prior densities are more efficient than common Bayesian designs based on posterior credible intervals and common frequentist designs. In contrast to trial designs based on Bayesian credible intervals, we demonstrate that the mis-specification of the prior densities used to describe the anticipated effect of the experimental treatment in designs based on hypothesis tests cannot increase the expected weight of evidence in favor of the trial agent.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLIMITATIONS: Extension of test-based designs to phase I-II designs and randomized phase II designs remains an open research question.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Phase II single-arm trials designed using Bayesian hypothesis tests with nonlocal alternatives provide better operating characteristics, use fewer patients per correct decision, and provide more directly interpretable results than other commonly used Bayesian and frequentist designs. Because the mis-specification of the prior density on the effect of the experimental agent decreases the expected weight of evidence that is collected in favor of the experimental treatment, the use of Bayesian hypothesis tests to design clinical trials also eliminates a potential source of bias often associated with trials designed using posterior credible intervals.},

The response rate and survival did not differ significantly between patients assigned to receive cisplatin and paclitaxel and those assigned to receive any of the three experimental regimens. Treatment with cisplatin and gemcitabine was associated with a significantly longer time to the progression of disease than was treatment with cisplatin and paclitaxel but was more likely to cause grade 3, 4, or 5 renal toxicity (in 9 percent of patients, vs. 3 percent of those treated with cisplatin plus paclitaxel). Patients with a performance status of 2 had a significantly lower rate of survival than did those with a performance status of 0 or 1.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: None of four chemotherapy regimens offered a significant advantage over the others in the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.},

This has changed the role of allo-SCT and the number of patients undergoing allo-SCT has declined dramatically. Allo-SCT is currently recommended for patients in accelerated/blast phase disease, those who have failed a second-generation TKI and those with TKI-resistant mutations such as T315I.

abstract = {WinBUGS is a fully extensible modular framework for constructing and analysing Bayesian full probability models. Models may be specified either textually via the BUGS language or pictorially using a graphical interface called DoodleBUGS. WinBUGS processes the model specification and constructs an object-oriented representation of the model. The software offers a user-interface, based on dialogue boxes and menu commands, throughwhich the modelmay then be analysed using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. In this paper we discuss how and why various modern computing concepts, such as object-orientation and run-time linking, feature in the software's design. We also discuss how the framework may be extended. It is possible to write specific applications that form an apparently seamless interface with WinBUGS for users with specialized requirements. It is also possible to interface withWinBUGS at a lower level by incorporating new object types that may be used by WinBUGS without knowledge of the modules in which they are implemented. Neither of these types of extension require access to, or even recompilation of, theWinBUGS source-code.},

abstract = {Although sample size calculations have become an important element in the design of research projects, such methods for studies involving current status data are scarce. Here, we propose a method for calculating power and sample size for studies using current status data. This method is based on a Weibull survival model for a two-group comparison. The Weibull model allows the investigator to specify a group difference in terms of a hazards ratio or a failure time ratio. We consider exponential, Weibull and uniformly distributed censoring distributions. We base our power calculations on a parametric approach with the Wald test because it is easy for medical investigators to conceptualize and specify the required input variables. As expected, studies with current status data have substantially less power than studies with the usual right-censored failure time data. Our simulation results demonstrate the merits of these proposed power calculations.},

abstract = {SUMMARY The case for preferring analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to the simple analysis of change scores (SACS) has often been made. Nevertheless, claims continue to be made that analysis of covariance is biased if the groups are not equal at baseline. If the required equality were in expectation only, this would permit the use of ANCOVA in randomized clinical trials but not in observational studies. The discussion is related to Lord's paradox. In this note, it is shown, however that it is not a necessary condition for groups to be equal at baseline, not even in expectation, for ANCOVA to provide unbiased estimates of treatment effects. It is also shown that although many situations can be envisaged where ANCOVA is biased it is very difficult to imagine circumstances under which SACS would then be unbiased and a causal interpretation could be made.},

abstract = {A 2-tiered histologic grading scheme for canine cutaneous mast cell tumors (MCTs) is based on morphologic characteristics of neoplastic cells, including karyomegaly, multinucleation, nuclear pleomorphism, and mitotic figures. Aspirates from MCTs may provide the same information more quickly, inexpensively, and less invasively. This study used these criteria to develop a cytologic grading scheme for canine MCTs to predict outcome. Three anatomic pathologists graded histologic samples from 152 canine MCTs. Three clinical pathologists evaluated aspirates from these masses using similar criteria. A cytologic grading scheme was created based on correlation with histologic grade and evaluated with a kappa statistic. Survival was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios for tumor grades and individual grading components. Simple logistic regression tested for relationships between risk factors and mortality. The cytologic grading scheme that best correlated with histology (kappa = 0.725 ± 0.085) classified a tumor as high grade if it was poorly granulated or had at least 2 of 4 findings: mitotic figures, binucleated or multinucleated cells, nuclear pleomorphism, or {\textgreater}50{\%} anisokaryosis. The cytologic grading scheme had 88{\%} sensitivity and 94{\%} specificity relative to histologic grading. Dogs with histologic and cytologic high grade MCTs were 39 times and 25 times more likely to die within the 2-year follow-up period, respectively, than dogs with low grade MCTs. High tumor grade was associated with increased probability of additional tumors or tumor regrowth. This study concluded that cytologic grade is a useful predictor for treatment planning and prognostication.},

abstract = {Some years ago, in the pages of this journal, Goodman gave an interesting analysis of 'replication probabilities' of p-values. Speci{\"{y}}cally, he considered the possibility that a given experiment had produced a p-value that indicated 'signi{\"{y}}cance' or near signi{\"{y}}cance (he con-sidered the range p = 0:10 to 0.001) and then calculated the probability that a study with equal power would produce a signi{\"{y}}cant result at the conventional level of signi{\"{y}}cance of 0.05. He showed, for example, that given an uninformative prior, and (subsequently) a result-ing p-value that was exactly 0.05 from the {\"{y}}rst experiment, the probability of signi{\"{y}}cance in the second experiment was 50 per cent. A more general form of this result is as follows. If the {\"{y}}rst trial yields p = then the probability that a second trial will be signi{\"{y}}cant at signi{\"{y}}cance level (and in the same direction as the {\"{y}}rst trial) is 0.5. I share many of Goodman's misgiving about p-values and I do not disagree with his calculations (except in slight numerical details). I also consider that his demonstration is useful for two reasons. First, it serves as a warning for anybody planning a further similar study to one just completed (and which has a marginally signi{\"{y}}cant result) that this may not be matched in the second study. Second, it serves as a warning that apparent inconsistency in results from individual studies may be expected to be common and that one should not overreact to this phenomenon. However, I disagree with two points that he makes. First, he claims that 'the replication probability provides a means, within the frequentist framework, to separate p-values from their hypothesis test interpretation, an important {\"{y}}rst step towards understanding the concept of inferential meaning' (p. 879). I disagree with him on two grounds here: (i) it is not necessary to separate p-values from their hypothesis test interpretation; (ii) the replication probability has no direct bearing on inferential meaning. Second he claims that, 'the replication probability can be used as a frequentist counterpart of Bayesian and likelihood models to show that p-values overstate the evidence against the null-hypothesis' (p. 875, my italics). I disagree that there is such an overstatement.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: As there are limited patients for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia trials, it is important that statistical methodologies in Phase II efficiently select regimens for subsequent evaluation in larger-scale Phase III trials.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We propose the screened selection design (SSD), which is a practical multi-stage, randomised Phase II design for two experimental arms. Activity is first evaluated by applying Simon's two-stage design (1989) on each arm. If both are active, the play-the-winner selection strategy proposed by Simon, Wittes and Ellenberg (SWE) (1985) is applied to select the superior arm. A variant of the design, Modified SSD, also allows the arm with the higher response rates to be recommended only if its activity rate is greater by a clinically-relevant value. The operating characteristics are explored via a simulation study and compared to a Bayesian Selection approach.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Simulations showed that with the proposed SSD, it is possible to retain the sample size as required in SWE and obtain similar probabilities of selecting the correct superior arm of at least 90{\%}; with the additional attractive benefit of reducing the probability of selecting ineffective arms. This approach is comparable to a Bayesian Selection Strategy. The Modified SSD performs substantially better than the other designs in selecting neither arm if the underlying rates for both arms are desirable but equivalent, allowing for other factors to be considered in the decision making process. Though its probability of correctly selecting a superior arm might be reduced, it still performs reasonably well. It also reduces the probability of selecting an inferior arm.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: SSD provides an easy to implement randomised Phase II design that selects the most promising treatment that has shown sufficient evidence of activity, with available R codes to evaluate its operating characteristics.},

Because this estimate is imprecise, stopping rules for toxicity are used in many phase II trials. We give recommendations on how to construct stopping rules to monitor toxicity continuously. A table is provided from which Pocock stopping boundaries can be easily obtained for a range of toxicity rates and sample sizes. Estimation of the probability of toxicity and response is also discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ponatinib is a potent oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor of unmutated and mutated BCR-ABL, including BCR-ABL with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor-refractory threonine-to-isoleucine mutation at position 315 (T315I). We conducted a phase 2 trial of ponatinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-positive ALL). METHODS: We enrolled 449 heavily pretreated patients who had CML or Ph-positive ALL with resistance to or unacceptable side effects from dasatinib or nilotinib or who had the BCR-ABL T315I mutation. Ponatinib was administered at an initial dose of 45 mg once daily. The median follow-up was 15 months. RESULTS: Among 267 patients with chronic-phase CML, 56{\%} had a major cytogenetic response (51{\%} of patients with resistance to or unacceptable side effects from dasatinib or nilotinib and 70{\%} of patients with the T315I mutation), 46{\%} had a complete cytogenetic response (40{\%} and 66{\%} in the two subgroups, respectively), and 34{\%} had a major molecular response (27{\%} and 56{\%} in the two subgroups, respectively). Responses were observed regardless of the baseline BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation status and were durable; the estimated rate of a sustained major cytogenetic response of at least 12 months was 91{\%}. No single BCR-ABL mutation conferring resistance to ponatinib was detected. Among 83 patients with accelerated-phase CML, 55{\%} had a major hematologic response and 39{\%} had a major cytogenetic response. Among 62 patients with blast-phase CML, 31{\%} had a major hematologic response and 23{\%} had a major cytogenetic response. Among 32 patients with Ph-positive ALL, 41{\%} had a major hematologic response and 47{\%} had a major cytogenetic response. Common adverse events were thrombocytopenia (in 37{\%} of patients), rash (in 34{\%}), dry skin (in 32{\%}), and abdominal pain (in 22{\%}). Serious arterial thrombotic events were observed in 9{\%} of patients; these events were considered to be treatment-related in 3{\%}. A total of 12{\%} of patients discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: Ponatinib had significant antileukemic activity across categories of disease stage and mutation status.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulphate (DHEAS) are pleiotropic adrenal hormones with immunostimulating and antiglucocorticoid effects. The present study was conducted to evaluate the time course of DHEAS levels in critically ill patients and to study their association with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. MATERIALS AND METHOD: This was a prospective observational clinical and laboratory study, including 30 patients with septic shock, eight patients with multiple trauma, and 40 age- and sex-matched control patients. We took serial measurements of blood concentrations of DHEAS, cortisol, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and IL-6, and of adrenocorticotrophic hormone immunoreactivity over 14 days or until discharge/death. RESULTS: On admission, DHEAS was extremely low in septic shock (1.2 +/- 0.8 mol/l) in comparison with multiple trauma patients (2.4 +/- 0.5 micromol/l; P {\textless} 0.05) and control patients (4.2 +/- 1.8; P {\textless} 0.01). DHEAS had a significant (P {\textless} 0.01) negative correlation with age, IL-6 and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores in both patient groups. Only during the acute phase did DHEAS negatively correlate with dopamine. Nonsurvivors of septic shock (n = 11) had lower DHEAS levels (0.4 +/- 0.3 micromol/l) than did survivors (1.7 +/- 1.1 micromol/l; P {\textless} 0.01). The time course of DHEAS exhibited a persistent depletion during follow up, whereas cortisol levels were increased at all time points. CONCLUSION: We identified extremely low DHEAS levels in septic shock and, to a lesser degree, in multiple trauma patients as compared with those of age- and sex-matched control patients. There appeared to be a dissociation between DHEAS (decreased) and cortisol (increased) levels, which changed only slightly over time. Nonsurvivors of sepsis and patients with relative adrenal insufficiency had the lowest DHEAS values, suggesting that DHEAS might be a prognostic marker and a sign of exhausted adrenal reserve in critical illness.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Imatinib mesylate is the first line treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia. In patients with advanced phase of the disease, the advent of imatinib significantly increased survival. However, few long-term data, based on large, prospective and controlled trials are available on the outcome of these patients. DESIGN AND METHODS:We conducted a phase II trial of imatinib 600 mg daily in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis. The return to chronic phase was defined as {\textless}15{\%} blasts and {\textless}30{\%} blasts plus promyelocytes in blood or bone marrow and {\textless}20{\%} peripheral basophils. A complete hematologic response required the normalization of platelet and white cell differential counts and absence of extramedullary involvement. Cytogenetic response was assessed by the standard banding technique and rated as usual. RESULTS:Ninety-two patients were enrolled (20 with lymphoid blast crisis and 72 with myeloid blast crisis). Forty-six patients (50{\%}) returned to chronic phase, and 24 patients (26{\%}) achieved also a complete hematologic response. Sixteen patients (17{\%}) had a cytogenetic response (9 complete, 1 partial, and 6 minor or minimal). The complete cytogenetic response was subsequently lost by all but two patients between 2 and 12 months after first having achieved it: the median duration of complete cytogenetic response was 7 months. All responses were sustained for a minimum of 4 weeks. The median survival of all the patients was 7 months. After a median observation time of 66 months, seven (8{\%}) patients are alive. Three of these patients are on imatinib treatment (1 in complete hematologic remission, 1 in partial cytogenetic response and 1 in complete cytogenetic remission). Three patients are in complete remission after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. One patient is alive in blast crisis, on therapy with a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS:Imatinib was effective and safe in the short-term treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis, but longer-term outcome was not significantly influenced (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00514969).},

Conaway and Petroni further pointed out that it is important to evaluate the clinical activity and safety simultaneously in studying cancer treatments with more toxic chemotherapies in a phase II clinical trial. Therefore, they developed multi-stage designs with two dependent binary endpoints. However, the usual sample sizes in phase II trials make these designs difficult to control the type I error rate at a desired level over the entire null region and still have sufficient power against reasonable alternatives. Therefore, the curtailed sampling procedure summarized by Phatak and Bhatt will be applied to the two-stage designs with two dependent binary endpoints in this paper to reduce sample sizes and speed up the development process for drugs.},

abstract = {We previously demonstrated vast expansion of hypoxic areas in the leukemic microenvironment and provided rationale for using hypoxia-activated prodrugs. PR104 is a phosphate ester that is rapidly hydrolyzed in vivo to the corresponding alcohol PR-104A and further reduced to the amine and hydroxyl-amine nitrogen mustards that induce DNA cross-linking in hypoxic cells under low oxygen concentrations. In this phase I/II study, patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (n=40) after 1 or 2 prior treatments or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=10) after any number of prior treatments received PR104, dose ranges of 1.1 to 4 g/m2. The most common treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events were myelosuppression (anemia 62{\%}, neutropenia 50{\%}, thrombocytopenia 46{\%}), febrile neutropenia (40{\%}), infection (24{\%}), and enterocolitis (14{\%}). Ten of 31 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (32{\%}) and 2 of 10 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (20{\%}) who received 3 g/m2 or 4 g/m2 had a response (complete response, n=1; complete response without platelet recovery, n=5; morphologic leukemia-free state, n=6). The extent of hypoxia was evaluated by the hypoxia tracer pimonidazole administered prior to a bone marrow biopsy and by immunohistochemical assessments of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha and carbonic anhydrase IX. A high fraction of leukemic cells expressed these markers, and PR104 administration resulted in measurable decrease of the proportions of hypoxic cells. These findings indicate that hypoxia is a prevalent feature of the leukemic microenvironment and that targeting hypoxia with hypoxia-activated prodrugs warrants further evaluation in acute leukemia. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT 01037556.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the analysis of randomization effects in multi-centre clinical trials. The two randomization schemes most often used in clinical trials are considered: unstratified and centre-stratified block-permuted randomization. The prediction of the number of patients randomized to different treatment arms in different regions during the recruitment period accounting for the stochastic nature of the recruitment and effects of multiple centres is investigated. A new analytic approach using a Poisson-gamma patient recruitment model (patients arrive at different centres according to Poisson processes with rates sampled from a gamma distributed population) and its further extensions is proposed. Closed-form expressions for corresponding distributions of the predicted number of the patients randomized in different regions are derived. In the case of two treatments, the properties of the total imbalance in the number of patients on treatment arms caused by using centre-stratified randomization are investigated and for a large number of centres a normal approximation of imbalance is proved. The impact of imbalance on the power of the study is considered. It is shown that the loss of statistical power is practically negligible and can be compensated by a minor increase in sample size. The influence of patient dropout is also investigated. The impact of randomization on predicted drug supply overage is discussed.},

Comparison of follow up (post-treatment) scores will give a result such as “at the end of the trial, mean pain scores were 15 mm (95{\%} confidence interval 10 to 20 mm) lower in the treatment group.” Alternatively a change score can be calculated by subtracting the follow up score from the baseline score, leading to a statement such as “pain reductions were 20 mm (16 to 24 mm) greater on treatment than control.” If the average baseline scores are the same in each group the estimated treatment effect will be the same using these two simple approaches. If the treatment is effective the statistical significance of the treatment effect by the two methods will depend on the correlation between baseline and follow up scores.

abstract = {Traditionally, phase II cancer trials test a binary endpoint formed from a dichotomisation of the continuous change in tumour size. Directly testing the continuous endpoint provides considerable gains in power, although also results in several statistical issues. One such issue is when complete responses, i.e. complete tumour removal, are observed in multiple patients; this is a problem when normality is assumed. Using simulated data and a recently published phase II trial, we investigate how the choice of test affects the operating characteristics of the trial. We propose using parametric tests based on the censored normal distribution, comparing them to the t-test and Wilcoxon non-parametric test. The censored normal distribution fits the real dataset well, but simulations indicate its type-I error rate is inflated, and its power is only slightly higher than the t-test. The Wilcoxon test has deflated type I error. For two-arm designs, the differences are much smaller. We conclude that the t-test is suitable for use when complete responses are present, although positively skewed data can result in the non-parametric test having higher power.},

abstract = {Following traumatic brain injury (TBI), cascades of inflammatory processes occur. Laboratory studies implicate the cytokines interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) and IL-1beta in the pathophysiology of TBI and cerebral ischemia, whilst exogenous and endogenous interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) is neuroprotective. We analyzed IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-1ra in brain microdialysates (100-kDa membrane) in 15 TBI patients. We also analyzed energy-related molecules (glucose, lactate, pyruvate, glutamate, and the lactate/pyruvate ratio) in these brain microdialysates. Mean of mean (+/-SD) in vitro microdialysis percentage recoveries (extraction efficiencies) were IL-1alpha 19.7+/-7.6{\%}, IL-1beta 23.9+/-10.5{\%}, and IL-1ra 20.9+/-6.3{\%}. In the patients' brain microdialysates, mean of mean cytokine concentrations (not corrected for percentage recovery) were IL-1alpha 5.6+/-14.8 pg/mL, IL-1beta 10.4+/-14.7 pg/mL, and IL-1ra 2796+/-2918 pg/mL. IL-1ra was consistently much higher than IL-1alpha and IL-1beta. There were no significant relationships between IL-1 family cytokines and energy-related molecules. There was a significant correlation between increasing IL-1beta and increasing IL-1ra (Spearman r=0.59, p=0.028). There was also a significant relationship between increasing IL-1ra and decreasing intracranial pressure (Spearman r=-0.57, p=0.041). High concentrations of IL-1ra, and also high IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio, were associated with better outcome (Mann Whitney, p=0.018 and p=0.0201, respectively), within these 15 patients. It is unclear whether these IL-1ra concentrations are sufficient to antagonize the effects of IL-1beta in vivo. This study demonstrates feasibility of our microdialysis methodology in recovering IL-1 family cytokines for assessing their inter-relationships in the injured human brain, and suggests a neuroprotective role for IL-1ra. It remains to be seen whether exogenous IL-1ra or other agents can be used to manipulate cytokine levels in the brain, for potential therapeutic effect.},

In this article, we review research on how applied researchers who are not primarily statisticians misuse and misin-terpret p-values in practice and how this can lead to errors in the interpretation of evidence. We also present new data showing, perhaps surprisingly, that researchers who are primarily statisticians are also prone to misuse and misinterpret p-values thus resulting in similar errors. In particular, we show that statisticians tend to interpret evidence dichotomously based on whether or not a p-value crosses the conventional 0.05 threshold for statistical significance.

abstract = {Background: Appropriate outcome selection is essential if research is to guide decision-making and inform policy. Systematic reviews of the clinical, cosmetic and patient-reported outcomes of reconstruc-tive breast surgery, however, have demonstrated marked heterogeneity, and results from individual studies cannot be compared or combined. Use of a core outcome set may improve the situation. The BRAVO study developed a core outcome set for reconstructive breast surgery. Methods: A long list of outcomes identified from systematic reviews and stakeholder interviews was used to inform a questionnaire survey. Key stakeholders defined as individuals involved in decision-making for reconstructive breast surgery, including patients, breast and plastic surgeons, specialist nurses and psychologists, were sampled purposively and sent the questionnaire (round 1). This asked them to rate the importance of each outcome on a 9-point Likert scale from 1 (not important) to 9 (extremely important). The proportion of respondents rating each item as very important (score 7–9) was calculated. This was fed back to participants in a second questionnaire (round 2). Respondents were asked to reprioritize outcomes based on the feedback received. Items considered very important after round 2 were discussed at consensus meetings, where the core outcome set was agreed. Results: A total of 148 items were combined into 34 domains within six categories. Some 303 participants (51⋅4 per cent) (215 (49⋅5 per cent) of 434 patients; 88 (56⋅4 per cent) of 156 professionals) completed and returned the round 1 questionnaire, and 259 (85⋅5 per cent) reprioritized outcomes in round 2. Fifteen items were excluded based on questionnaire scores and 19 were carried forward to the consensus meetings, where a core outcome set containing 11 key outcomes was agreed. Conclusion: The BRAVO study has used robust consensus methodology to develop a core outcome set for reconstructive breast surgery. Widespread adoption by the reconstructive community will improve the quality of outcome assessment in effectiveness studies. Future work will evaluate how these key outcomes should best be measured.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Worldwide, over 10 million people are killed or hospitalized because of traumatic brain injury each year. About 90{\%} of deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. The condition mostly affects young adults, and many experience long lasting or permanent disability. The social and economic burden is considerable. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is commonly given to surgical patients to reduce bleeding and the need for blood transfusion. It has been shown to reduce the number of patients receiving a blood transfusion by about a third, reduces the volume of blood transfused by about one unit, and halves the need for further surgery to control bleeding in elective surgical patients. METHODS/DESIGN: The CRASH-3 trial is an international, multicenter, pragmatic, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to quantify the effects of the early administration of TXA on death and disability in patients with traumatic brain injury. Ten thousand adult patients who fulfil the eligibility criteria will be randomized to receive TXA or placebo. Adults with traumatic brain injury, who are within 8 h of injury and have any intracranial bleeding on computerized tomography (CT scan) or Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 12 or less can be included if the responsible doctor is substantially uncertain as to whether or not to use TXA in this patient. Patients with significant extracranial bleeding will be excluded since there is evidence that TXA improves outcome in these patients. Treatment will entail a 1 g loading dose followed by a 1 g maintenance dose over 8 h.The main analyses will be on an 'intention-to-treat' basis, irrespective of whether the allocated treatment was received. Results will be presented as appropriate effect estimates with a measure of precision (95{\%} confidence intervals). Subgroup analyses for the primary outcome will be based on time from injury to randomization, the severity of the injury, location of the bleeding, and baseline risk. Interaction tests will be used to test whether the effect of treatment differs across these subgroups. A study with 10,000 patients will have approximately 90{\%} power to detect a 15{\%} relative reduction from 20{\%} to 17{\%} in all-cause mortality.

abstract = {Objective: To describe a step-by-step guide to robot-assisted anterior partial prostatectomy (RA-APP) for isolated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-detected anterior prostate cancer (APC). Patients and Methods: After Institutional Review Board approval, over an 8-year period (2008–2015), 17 consenting patients were enrolled in a prospective, single-arm, single-centre, Idea, Development, Evaluation, Assessment and Long-term evaluation of innovative surgery (IDEAL) phase 2a study. The inclusion criteria comprised pre-urethral, low–intermediate risk APC diagnosed by MRI and targeted biopsies. Patient position and port placement were identical to the transperitoneal RA radical prostatectomy procedure. Three steps of dissection were identified in the following order: (i) retrograde apical, after dorsal venous plexus division, transition zone (TZ) enucleation, and distal peripheral zone (PZ) sectioning; (ii) antegrade, at the bladder neck (BN) after anterior BN sectioning, TZ enucleation up to the verumontanum; and (iii) lateral dissections, including anterolateral PZ sectioning without incision of the endopelvic fascia. We report the incidence of perioperative complications. The RA completion of prostatectomy in four cases with cancer recurrence was performed at 0.3, 2.5, 2 and 2 years, respectively. Results: The RA-APP comprised en bloc excision of the anterior part of the prostate comprising of the anterior fibromuscular stroma, BN, prostate adenoma (TZ and median lobe) along with the proximal prostate urethra, PZ apical anterior horns, anterior aspect of the distal (sub-montanal) urethra, and anterior BN. The posterolateral parts of the PZ and distal (sub-montanal) urethra and peri-prostatic tissues were preserved intact. The bladder opening was sutured to the anterior sphincteric urethra wall and PZ lateral edges. The technique was feasible in all cases with no conversion to an open procedure. Perioperative complications were only Clavien–Dindo grade II. RA completion of prostatectomy was feasible in the four cases with cancer recurrence. Conclusion: PZ prostate-sparing RA-APP for isolated APC is feasible and safe, and represents an option for highly selected men with APCs as an alternative to other focal ablative therapy.},

abstract = {Summary. Wolfram syndrome is the association of diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy, and is sometimes called DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness). Incomplete characterisation of this autosomal recessive syndrome has relied on case-reports, and there is confusion with mitochondrial genome disorders. We therefore undertook a UK nationwide cross-sectional case-finding study to describe the natural history, complications, prevalence, and inheritance of the syndrome. We identified 45 patients with Wolfram syndrome-a prevalence of one per 770000. Non-autoimmune, insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus presented at a median age of 6 years, followed by optic atrophy (11 years). Cranial diabetes insipidus occurred in 33 patients (73{\%}) with sensorineural deafness (28, 62{\%}) in the second decade; renal-tract abnormalities (26, 58{\%}) presented in the third decade followed by neurological complications (cerebellar ataxia, myoclonus [28, 62{\%}]) in the fourth decade. Other abnormalities included gastrointestinal dysmotility in 11 (24{\%}), and primary gonadal atrophy in seven of ten males investigated. Median age at death (commonly central respiratory failure with brain-stem atrophy) was 30 years (range 25-49). The natural history of Wolfram syndrome suggests that most patients will eventually develop most complications of this progressive, neurodegenerative disorder. Family studies indicate autosomal recessive inheritance with a carrier frequency of one in 354, an absence of a maternal history of diabetes or deafness, and an absence of the mitochondrial tRNA Leu (3243) mutation. Juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy are the best available diagnostic criteria for Wolfram syndrome, the differential diagnosis of which includes other causes of neurodegeneration. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Designs and analyses of clinical trials with a time-to-event outcome almost invariably rely on the hazard ratio to estimate the treatment effect and implicitly, therefore, on the proportional hazards assumption. However, the results of some recent trials indicate that there is no guarantee that the assumption will hold. Here, we describe the use of the restricted mean survival time as a possible alternative tool in the design and analysis of these trials.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The restricted mean is a measure of average survival from time 0 to a specified time point, and may be estimated as the area under the survival curve up to that point. We consider the design of such trials according to a wide range of possible survival distributions in the control and research arm(s). The distributions are conveniently defined as piecewise exponential distributions and can be specified through piecewise constant hazards and time-fixed or time-dependent hazard ratios. Such designs can embody proportional or non-proportional hazards of the treatment effect.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We demonstrate the use of restricted mean survival time and a test of the difference in restricted means as an alternative measure of treatment effect. We support the approach through the results of simulation studies and in real examples from several cancer trials. We illustrate the required sample size under proportional and non-proportional hazards, also the significance level and power of the proposed test. Values are compared with those from the standard approach which utilizes the logrank test.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the hazard ratio cannot be recommended as a general measure of the treatment effect in a randomized controlled trial, nor is it always appropriate when designing a trial. Restricted mean survival time may provide a practical way forward and deserves greater attention.},

abstract = {This paper aims at assisting empirical researchers benefit from recent advances in causal inference. The paper stresses the paradigmatic shifts that must be under- taken in moving from traditional statistical analysis to causal analysis of multivari- ate data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underly all causal in- ferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, and the conditional nature of causal claims inferred from nonexperimental studies. These emphases are illustrated through a brief survey of recent results, including the control of confounding, the assessment of causal effects, the interpretation of counterfactuals, and a symbiosis between counterfactual and graphical methods of analysis.},

abstract = {Phase I clinical trials are an essential step in the development of anticancer drugs. The main goal of these studies is to establish the recommended dose and/or schedule of new drugs or drug combinations for phase II trials. The guiding principle for dose escalation in phase I trials is to avoid exposing too many patients to subtherapeutic doses while preserving safety and maintaining rapid accrual. Here we review dose escalation methods for phase I trials, including the rule-based and model-based dose escalation methods that have been developed to evaluate new anticancer agents. Toxicity has traditionally been the primary endpoint for phase I trials involving cytotoxic agents. However, with the emergence of molecularly targeted anticancer agents, potential alternative endpoints to delineate optimal biological activity, such as plasma drug concentration and target inhibition in tumor or surrogate tissues, have been proposed along with new trial designs. We also describe specific methods for drug combinations as well as methods that use a time-to-event endpoint or both toxicity and efficacy as endpoints. Finally, we present the advantages and drawbacks of the various dose escalation methods and discuss specific applications of the methods in developmental oncotherapeutics.},

In the 50- to 60-yr-old group, serum DHEA decreased by 74{\%} and 70{\%} from its peak values in 20- to 30-yr-old men and women, respectively. the serum concentrations of the conjugated metabolites of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), namely androsterone (ADT)-G, androstane-3 alpha,17 beta-diol (3 alpha-diol-G), androstane-3 beta,17 beta-diol (3 beta-diol-G), and ADT-sulfate are the most reliable parameters of the total androgen pool in both men and women, whereas serum testosterone and DHT can be used as markers of testicular secretion in men and interstitial ovarian secretion in women. The serum concentration of these various conjugated androgen metabolites decreased by 40.8{\%} to 72.8{\%} between the 20- to 30-yr-old and 70- to 80-yr-old age groups in men and women, respectively, thus suggesting a parallel decrease in the total androgen pool with age. As estimated by measurement of the circulating levels of these conjugated metabolites of DHT, it is noteworthy that women produce approximately 66{\%} of the total androgens found in men. In women, most of these androgens originate from the transformation of DHEA and DHEA-S into testosterone and DHT in peripheral intracrine tissues, whereas in men the testes and DHEA and DHEA-S provide approximately equal amounts of androgens at the age of 50-60 yr. An additional potentially highly significant observation is that the majority of the marked decline in circulating adrenal C19 steroids and their resulting androgen metabolites takes place between the age groups of 20- to 30-yr olds and 50- to 60-yr-olds, with smaller changes are observed after the age of 60 yr.},

It is now generally accepted that BC is the consequence of continued BCR-ABL activity leading to genetic instability, DNA damage, and im-paired DNA repair. Most patients with BC carry multiple mutations, and up to 80{\%} show additional chromosomal aber-rations in a nonrandom pattern. Treat-ment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors has improved survival in BC modestly, but most long-term survivors are those who have been transplanted. Patients in BC should be treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor according to mutation profile, with or without chemotherapy, with the goal of achieving a second chronic phase and proceeding to allogeneic stem cell transplantation as quickly as possible. Although long-term remissions are rare, allogeneic stem cell transplantation pro-vides the best chance of a cure in BC. Investigational agents are not likely to provide an alternative in the near future. In view of these limited options, preven-tion of BC by a rigorous and early elimina-tion of BCR-ABL is recommended. Early response indicators should be used to select patients for alternative therapies and early transplantation. Every attempt should be made to reduce or eliminate BCR-ABL consistent with good patient care as far as possible. (Blood. 2012; 120(4):737-747)},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab is the standard-of-care treatment for patients with advanced melanoma. Pembrolizumab inhibits the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint and has antitumor activity in patients with advanced melanoma. METHODS In this randomized, controlled, phase 3 study, we assigned 834 patients with advanced melanoma in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive pembrolizumab (at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight) every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks or four doses of ipilimumab (at 3 mg per kilogram) every 3 weeks. Primary end points were progression-free and overall survival. RESULTS The estimated 6-month progression-free-survival rates were 47.3{\%} for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks, 46.4{\%} for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, and 26.5{\%} for ipilimumab (hazard ratio for disease progression, 0.58; P{\textless}0.001 for both pembrolizumab regimens versus ipilimumab; 95{\%} confidence intervals [CIs], 0.46 to 0.72 and 0.47 to 0.72, respectively). Estimated 12-month survival rates were 74.1{\%}, 68.4{\%}, and 58.2{\%}, respectively (hazard ratio for death for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks, 0.63; 95{\%} CI, 0.47 to 0.83; P=0.0005; hazard ratio for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, 0.69; 95{\%} CI, 0.52 to 0.90; P=0.0036). The response rate was improved with pembrolizumab administered every 2 weeks (33.7{\%}) and every 3 weeks (32.9{\%}), as compared with ipilimumab (11.9{\%}) (P{\textless}0.001 for both comparisons). Responses were ongoing in 89.4{\%}, 96.7{\%}, and 87.9{\%} of patients, respectively, after a median follow-up of 7.9 months. Efficacy was similar in the two pembrolizumab groups. Rates of treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 to 5 severity were lower in the pembrolizumab groups (13.3{\%} and 10.1{\%}) than in the ipilimumab group (19.9{\%}). CONCLUSIONS The anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival and had less high-grade toxicity than did ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma.

P{\textless}0.05 was regarded as significant.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Forty-one children were identified having undergone 49 procedures, with median age 15 (12-16 years) and follow up 32 (8-92) months. Groups were comparable for disease severity. Ten children underwent primary PEF and twenty-six LFP. Two children had recurrence following primary PEF and had repeat PEF which was curative. Overall recurrence rates following PEF procedure were comparable to LFP (17{\%} vs 21{\%}; P=1.0). There were no wound dehiscences in the PEF group and one wound infection. There was one wound dehiscence and one wound infection in the LFP group. Median operative time for PEF was lower than LFP (20 vs 60 min, P=0.001). 83{\%} of PEF procedures were performed as day cases. One child was lost to follow up, and two children progressed to adult services.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We recommend PEF in children with pilonidal sinus disease as primary treatment and for recurrence. PEF has comparable recurrence and wound infection rates to LFPs, is performed as day case, has shorter anaesthetic times, and the risk of wound dehiscence is avoided.},

abstract = {We present a class of simple designs that can be used in early dose-finding studies in HIV. Such designs, in contrast with Phase I designs in cancer, have a lot of the Phase II flavor about them. Information on efficacy is obtained during the trial and is as important as that relating to toxicity. The designs proposed here sequentially incorporate the information obtained on viral reduction. Initial doses are given from some fixed range of dose regimens. The doses are ordered in terms of their toxic potential. At any dose, a patient can have one of three outcomes: inability to take the treatment (toxicity), ability to take the treatment but insufficient reduction in viral load (viral failure), and ability to take the treatment as well as a sufficient reduction of viral load (success). A clear goal for some class of designs would be the identification of the dose leading to the greatest percentage of successes. Under certain assumptions, which we identify and discuss, we can obtain efficient designs for this task. Under weaker, sometimes more realistic assumptions, we can still obtain designs that have good operating characteristics in identifying a level, if such a level exists, having some given or greater success rate. In the absence of such a level, the designs will come to an early closure, indicating the ineffectiveness of the new treatment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Mast cell tumors (MCT) represent the most common malignant skin tumor in the dog. Diagnosis of an MCT can be achieved through cytologic examination of a fine-needle aspirate. However, the grade of the tumor is an important prognostic marker and currently requires histologic assessment. Recently a 2-tier histologic grading system based on nuclear features including number of mitoses, multinucleated cells, bizarre nuclei, and karyomegaly was proposed. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to assess if the cytomorphologic criteria proposed in the 2-tier histologic grading system are applicable to cytology specimens. METHODS A total of 141 MCT specimens reported as grade I, II, or III according to the Patnaik system with both histologic specimens and fine-needle aspirates available were histologically and cytologically reevaluated in a retrospective study. RESULTS According to the 2-tier grading system, 38 cases were diagnosed histologically as high-grade and 103 as low-grade MCT. Cytologic grading resulted in 36 high-grade and 105 low-grade tumors. Agreement between histologic and cytologic grading based on the 2-tier grading system was achieved in 133 cases (sensitivity 86.8{\%}, specificity 97.1{\%}, kappa value 0.853), but 5 high-grade tumors on histology were classified as low-grade on cytology. CONCLUSION Cytologic grading of MCT in the dog is helpful for initial assessment. However, the reliability of cytology using the 2-tier grading system is considered inadequate at this point.

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs) have become increasingly prominent in psycholin-guistics and related areas. However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how ran-dom effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F 1 and F 2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F 1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the 'gold standard' for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

abstract = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.2.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propa- gation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line, through R using the RStan package, or through Python using the PyStan package. All three interfaces support sampling or optimization-based inference and analysis, and RStan and PyStan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, and data I/O.},

In The Lancet, Roy Herbst and colleagues 1 report the results of KEYNOTE-010, a randomised phase 2/3 study in 202 academic medical centres in 24 countries that compared two doses of pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) with docetaxel (75 mg/m²) every 3 weeks in 1034 patients with previously treated, PD-L1-positive, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. This biomarker-enriched study had two primary endpoints of overall survival and progression-free survival both in the total population and in the subgroup of patients with tumour proportion score of 50{\%} or more, which is defi ned as the percentage of tumour cells expressing PD-L1 assessed by immunohistochemistry using antibody 22C3. In the total study population, there was signifi cant improvement in overall survival with pembrolizumab compared with docetaxel for both pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg (n=344; hazard ratio [HR] 0{\textperiodcentered}71, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}58–0{\textperiodcentered}88; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0008) and pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg (n=346; 0{\textperiodcentered}61, 0{\textperiodcentered}49–0{\textperiodcentered}75; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Median progression-free survival was similar in all three groups (3{\textperiodcentered}9 months with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 4{\textperiodcentered}0 months with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 4{\textperiodcentered}0 months with docetaxel) and diff erence between both doses of pembrolizumab versus docetaxel did not meet the pre-specifi ed threshold for statistical signifi cance (2 mg/kg 0{\textperiodcentered}88, 0{\textperiodcentered}74–1{\textperiodcentered}05; p=0{\textperiodcentered}070; 10 mg/kg HR 0{\textperiodcentered}79, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}66–0{\textperiodcentered}94; p=0{\textperiodcentered}004). In patients with at least 50{\%} of tumour cells expressing PD-L1, overall survival was signifi cantly longer with pembrolizumab than with docetaxel (for 2 mg/kg median 14{\textperiodcentered}9 months vs 8{\textperiodcentered}2 months, HR 0{\textperiodcentered}54, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}38–0{\textperiodcentered}77, p=0{\textperiodcentered}0002; and for 10 mg/kg 17{\textperiodcentered}3 months vs 8{\textperiodcentered}2 months, 0{\textperiodcentered}50, 0{\textperiodcentered}36–0{\textperiodcentered}70, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Treatment-related adverse events were similar between the two doses of pembrolizumab but less common than with docetaxel. The results of KEYNOTE-010 support the recent approval of pembrolizumab for the management of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. 2 However, these fi ndings need to be interpreted in light of two other randomised phase 3 studies of immune check-point inhibitors comparing second-line nivolumab with docetaxel, namely the CHECKMATE-017 and CHECKMATE-057 (table). 3,4 Amid the excitement of immuno-oncology, we must remain rational and address key questions related to the practical application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for advanced stage non-small-cell lung cancer. Namely, should immune checkpoint inhibitors be given as second-line or third-line therapy? Is the biomarker of PD-L1 expression according to tumour proportion score reliable and should all patients be tested before starting treatment? What is the optimum dose of pembrolizumab in advanced stage non-small-cell lung cancer? More importantly, given the hefty costs of these drugs, are they considered cost eff ective?

@article{Thall2005,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In many early phase clinical trials it is scientifically inappropriate or logistically infeasible to characterize patient outcome as a binary variable. In such settings, it often is more natural to construct early stopping rules based on time-to-event variables. This type of design may involve a variety of complications, however. PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to illustrate by example how one may deal with various complications that may arise when monitoring time-to-event outcomes in an early phase clinical trial. METHODS: We present a series of Bayesian designs for a phase II clinical trial in kidney cancer. Each design includes a procedure for monitoring the times to a severe adverse event, disease progression and death. The first design, which is the simplest, is based on the time to failure, defined as any of the three events, assuming exponentially distributed failure times with an inverse gamma prior on the mean. This design is compared by simulation to the CMAP design (Cheung and Thall, Biometrics, 2002; 58: 89-97). The model and monitoring procedure are then extended successively to accommodate several common practical complications, and we also study the method's robustness. RESULTS: Our simulations show that 1) one may apply the monitoring rule periodically, rather than continuously, without a substantive degradation of the design's reliability; 2) it is very important to account for interval censoring due to periodic evaluation of disease status; 3) it is important to account for the effect of disease progression on the subsequent death rate; 4) conducting a randomized trial presents little additional difficulty and provides unbiased comparisons; and 5) the exponential-inverse gamma model is surprisingly robust in most cases. LIMITATIONS: The methods discussed here do not account for patient heterogeneity. This is an important but complex issue that may be dealt with by extending the models and methods given here to accommodate patient covariates and treatment-covariate interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Bayesian procedures for monitoring time-to-event outcomes offer a practical way to conduct a variety of early phase trials. Considerable care must be given, however, to modeling the important aspects of the trial at hand, and to calibrating the prior and the design parameters to ensure that the design will have good operating characteristics.},

abstract = {Phase II clinical trials in oncology are used to initially evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a new treatment regimen. Simon's two-stage design is commonly used for such trials. However, he only focused on the "response rate", the proportion of patients experiencing tumor regression. In clinical practice, it is preferred of a sequential design to monitor antitumor activity as well as toxicity. Conaway and Petroni proposed a method for designing phase II trials on the basis of both treatment efficacy and safety, which imply an equal weighing of response and toxicity. In this paper, we developed an alternative test to cope with the trade-off between safety and efficacy. The main idea is to control for the marginal type I errors of response rate and toxicity rate separately. We provide guides on searching the stopping and rejecting regions and determination of sample size. The proposed method has advantage over other designs, including those of Conaway and Petroni's and Bryant and Day's, that it can definitely control one type I error of the interests such as treatment antitumor activity or safety and is robust against the real association parameter. Furthermore, it is conceptive intuitive, very simple to implement, and also feasible for the requirement of small sample size in a phase II trial. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We then summarize the evidence for cell cycle perturbations in Alzheimer's disease and discuss the possible significance these may have for the development of pathological changes in this disease. Our working hypothesis is that, contrary to previous belief, neurons in the adult human brain are capable of re-entering the cell division cycle. The progression of the cell cycle is normally arrested at an early stage and neurons are able to re-differentiate. However, in Alzheimer's disease the cell cycle is allowed to progress into the G2 phase. At this stage re-differentiation is not possible and the neurons will suffer one of two fates: either they will die via an apoptotic pathway or they may produce Alzheimer-type pathology.},

Two applications are described. The first is a trial of imatinib for sarcoma in which treatment activity is characterized by a binary indicator of tumour response. The second is a phase II trial of a new preparative regimen for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in patients with haematologic malignancies, with treatment effect characterized by the mean time from transplant to disease progression or death.

abstract = {PURPOSE: To describe and demonstrate methods for analyzing correlated binary eye  data. METHODS: We describe non-model based (McNemar's test, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test) and model-based methods (generalized linear mixed effects model, marginal model) for analyses involving both eyes. These methods were applied to: (1) CAPT (Complications of Age-related Macular Degeneration Prevention Trial) where one eye was treated and the other observed (paired design); (2) ETROP (Early Treatment for Retinopathy of Prematurity) where bilaterally affected infants had one eye treated conventionally and the other treated early and unilaterally affected infants had treatment assigned randomly; and (3) AREDS (Age-Related Eye Disease Study) where treatment was systemic and outcome was eye-specific (both eyes in the same treatment group). RESULTS: In the CAPT (n = 80), treatment group (30{\%} vision loss in treated vs. 44{\%} in observed eyes) was not statistically significant (p = 0.07) when inter-eye correlation was ignored, but was significant (p = 0.01) with McNemar's test and the marginal model. Using standard logistic regression for unfavorable vision in ETROP, standard errors and p-values were larger for person-level covariates and were smaller for ocular covariates than using models accounting for inter-eye correlation. For risk factors of geographic atrophy in AREDS, two-eye analyses accounting for inter-eye correlation yielded more power than one-eye analyses and provided larger standard errors and p-values than invalid two-eye analyses ignoring inter-eye correlation. CONCLUSION: Ignoring inter-eye correlation can lead to larger p-values for paired designs and smaller p-values when both eyes are in the same group. Marginal models or mixed effects models using the eye as the unit of analysis provide valid inference.},

We focus on the variable subset selection for regression and classification and perform several numerical experiments using both simulated and real world data. The results show that the optimization of a utility estimate such as the cross-validation score is liable to finding overfitted models due to relatively high variance in the utility estimates when the data is scarce. Better and much less varying results are obtained by incorporating all the uncertainties into a full encompassing model and projecting this information onto the submodels. The reference model projection appears to outperform also the maximum a posteriori model and the selection of the most probable variables. The study also demonstrates that the model selection can greatly benefit from using cross-validation outside the searching process both for guiding the model size selection and assessing the predictive performance of the finally selected model.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES The objective of the study is to conduct a systematic review to compare the effects of high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) with autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) versus standard-dose chemotherapy (SDCT) in children with malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumours. METHODS Standard systematic review methods aimed at minimising bias will be employed for study identification, selection and data extraction. Ten electronic databases will be searched, along with citation searching and reference checking. Studies assessing the effects of HDCT with HSCT in children with CNS tumours will be included. The outcomes are survival (overall, progression-free, event-free, disease-free), response rates, short- and long-term adverse events and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Two reviewers will independently screen and select randomised and non-randomised controlled trials and controlled and uncontrolled observational studies for inclusion. Quality assessment will be tailored to the different study designs. Where possible data will be summarised using combined estimates of effect for the hazard ratio for survival outcomes and the risk ratio for response rates. A fixed effect model will be used; sub-group analyses and meta-regression will be used to explore potential sources of heterogeneity between studies. DISCUSSION Given the poor prognosis of malignant brain tumours in children in terms of survival and quality of life, this review will help guide clinical practice by summarising the current evidence on the use of high-dose myeloblative chemotherapy with stem cell support in children with CNS tumours.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study how composite outcomes, which have combined several components into a single measure, are defined, reported, and interpreted.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: Systematic review of parallel group randomised clinical trials published in 2008 reporting a binary composite outcome. Two independent observers extracted the data using a standardised data sheet, and two other observers, blinded to the results, selected the most important component.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of 40 included trials, 29 (73{\%}) were about cardiovascular topics and 24 (60{\%}) were entirely or partly industry funded. Composite outcomes had a median of three components (range 2-9). Death or cardiovascular death was the most important component in 33 trials (83{\%}). Only one trial provided a good rationale for the choice of components. We judged that the components were not of similar importance in 28 trials (70{\%}); in 20 of these, death was combined with hospital admission. Other major problems were change in the definition of the composite outcome between the abstract, methods, and results sections (13 trials); missing, ambiguous, or uninterpretable data (9 trials); and post hoc construction of composite outcomes (4 trials). Only 24 trials (60{\%}) provided reliable estimates for both the composite and its components, and only six trials (15{\%}) had components of similar, or possibly similar, clinical importance and provided reliable estimates. In 11 of 16 trials with a statistically significant composite, the abstract conclusion falsely implied that the effect applied also to the most important component.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The use of composite outcomes in trials is problematic. Components are often unreasonably combined, inconsistently defined, and inadequately reported. These problems will leave many readers confused, often with an exaggerated perception of how well interventions work.},

@article{Mair2007,
abstract = {Item response theory models (IRT) are increasingly becoming established in social science research, particularly in the analysis of performance or attitudinal data in psy- chology, education, medicine, marketing and other fields where testing is relevant. We propose the R package eRm (extended Rasch modeling) for computing Rasch models and several extensions. A main characteristic of some IRT models, the Rasch model being the most prominent, concerns the separation of two kinds of parameters, one that describes qualities of the subject under investigation, and the other relates to qualities of the situation under which the response of a subject is observed. Using conditional maximum likelihood (CML) estimation both types of parameters may be estimated independently from each other. IRT models are well suited to cope with dichotomous and polytomous responses, where the response categories may be unordered as well as ordered. The incorporation of linear structures allows for modeling the effects of covariates and enables the analysis of repeated categorical measurements. The eRm package fits the following models: the Rasch model, the rating scale model (RSM), and the partial credit model (PCM) as well as linear reparameterizations through covariate structures like the linear logistic test model (LLTM), the linear rating scale model (LRSM), and the linear partial credit model (LPCM). We use an unitary, efficient CML approach to estimate the item parameters and their standard errors. Graphical and numeric tools for assessing goodness-of-fit are provided. Keywords:},

abstract = {Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) and the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC) are methods for estimating pointwise out-of-sample prediction accuracy from a fitted Bayesian model using the log-likelihood evaluated at the posterior simulations of the parameter values. LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called 'loo' and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

abstract = {Background Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 programmed death 1 (PD-1) immune-checkpoint-inhibitor antibody, disrupts PD-1-mediated signaling and may restore antitumor immunity. Methods In this randomized, open-label, international phase 3 study, we assigned patients with nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that had progressed during or after platinum-based doublet chemotherapy to receive nivolumab at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks or docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg per square meter of body-surface area every 3 weeks. The primary end point was overall survival. Results Overall survival was longer with nivolumab than with docetaxel. The median overall survival was 12.2 months (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 9.7 to 15.0) among 292 patients in the nivolumab group and 9.4 months (95{\%} CI, 8.1 to 10.7) among 290 patients in the docetaxel group (hazard ratio for death, 0.73; 96{\%} CI, 0.59 to 0.89; P=0.002). At 1 year, the overall survival rate was 51{\%} (95{\%} CI, 45 to 56) with nivolumab versus 39{\%} (95{\%} CI, 33 to 45) with docetaxel. With additional follow-up, the overall survival rate at 18 months was 39{\%} (95{\%} CI, 34 to 45) with nivolumab versus 23{\%} (95{\%} CI, 19 to 28) with docetaxel. The response rate was 19{\%} with nivolumab versus 12{\%} with docetaxel (P=0.02). Although progression-free survival did not favor nivolumab over docetaxel (median, 2.3 months and 4.2 months, respectively), the rate of progression-free survival at 1 year was higher with nivolumab than with docetaxel (19{\%} and 8{\%}, respectively). Nivolumab was associated with even greater efficacy than docetaxel across all end points in subgroups defined according to prespecified levels of tumor-membrane expression (≥1{\%}, ≥5{\%}, and ≥10{\%}) of the PD-1 ligand. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were reported in 10{\%} of the patients in the nivolumab group, as compared with 54{\%} of those in the docetaxel group. Conclusions Among patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC that had progressed during or after platinum-based chemotherapy, overall survival was longer with nivolumab than with docetaxel.

abstract = {Oncologists have a critical opportunity to utilize risk assessment and cancer prevention strategies to interrupt the initiation or progression of cancer in cancer survivors and individuals at high risk of developing cancer. Expanding knowledge about the natural history and prognosis of cancers positions oncologists to advise patients regarding the risk of second malignancies and treatment-related cancers. In addition, as recognized experts in the full spectrum of cancer care, oncologists are afforded opportunities for involvement in community-based cancer prevention activities. Although oncologists are currently providing many cancer prevention and risk assessment services to their patients, economic barriers exist, including inadequate or lack of insurance, that may compromise uniform patient access to these services. Additionally, insufficient reimbursement for existing and developing interventions may discourage patient access to these services. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the medical society representing cancer specialists involved in patient care and clinical research, is committed to supporting oncologists in their wide-ranging involvement in cancer prevention. This statement on risk assessment and prevention counseling, although not intended to be a comprehensive overview of cancer prevention describes the current role of oncologists in risk assessment and prevention; provides examples of risk assessment and prevention activities that should be offered by oncologists; identifies potential opportunities for coordination between oncologists and primary care physicians in prevention education and coordination of care for cancer survivors; describes ASCO's involvement in education and training of oncologists regarding prevention; and proposes improvement in the payment environment to encourage patient access to these services.},

abstract = {There is a growing realisation that neuro-inflammation plays a fundamental role in the pathology of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). This has led to the search for biomarkers that reflect these underlying inflammatory processes using techniques such as cerebral microdialysis. The interpretation of such biomarker data has been limited by the statistical methods used. When analysing data of this sort the multiple putative interactions between mediators need to be considered as well as the timing of production and high degree of statistical co-variance in levels of these mediators. Here we present a cytokine and chemokine dataset from human brain following human traumatic brain injury and use principal component analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis to demonstrate the pattern of production following TBI, distinct phases of the humoral inflammatory response and the differing patterns of response in brain and in peripheral blood. This technique has the added advantage of making no assumptions about the Relative Recovery (RR) of microdialysis derived parameters. Taken together these techniques can be used in complex microdialysis datasets to summarise the data succinctly and generate hypotheses for future study.},

Design: A survey of members of the MND Association of the UK, of which half were randomly allocated to receive a survey instrument from the MND Association and the other half allocated to receive the MND Association survey instrument and also the ALSAQ-40 questionnaire. Sample: Five hundred patients were randomly selected from the membership lists of the MND Association, of whom 250 received the MND Association Survey and the ALSAQ-40. Results: Response rate to the survey was 59.2{\%}. Over half of the respondents received the ALSAQ-40. Data for individual items were analysed and found to be distributed across all response categories. All items were found to be highly associated with the scales to which they contribute. Internal consistency reliability of all the five scales of the ALSAQ-40 was also found to be high. Conclusion: Inclusion of the ALSAQ-40 into the survey did not have an adverse effect upon response rates. Furthermore, the ALSAQ-40 was shown to have highly desirable psychometric properties.

Major dose-limited toxicity (DLT) was defined as grade 4 hematotoxicity, grade 3/4 febrile neutropenia, grade 3/4 non-hematotoxicity, skipped gemcitabine on days 8 and 15, or halting the course at or after 14 days. Dose-escalation and de-escalation decisions were based on the continual reassessment method. Every three patients were alternately assigned to each arm.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Thirty-three patients (14 intrahepatic bile duct, 1 gall bladder, 18 extrahepatic bile duct) were enrolled in this study from February 2011 to July 2012 (n = 18 gemcitabine, n = 15 S-1). At 10{\%} of DLT, the recommended dose was 1,000 mg/m(2) gemcitabine biweekly and 80 mg/m(2)/day S-1 on days 1-28 and every 6 weeks. Major DLT and adverse drug reactions were neutropenia. No grade 3 or 4 non-hematological adverse events were noted.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: We determined RDs for gemcitabine and S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy after major hepatectomy with a DLT that does not exceed 10{\%}.},

abstract = {The standard approach for documenting symptomatic adverse events (AEs) in cancer clinical trials involves investigator reporting using the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Because this approach underdetects symptomatic AEs, the NCI issued two contracts to create a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measurement system as a companion to the CTCAE, called the PRO-CTCAE. This Commentary describes development of the PRO-CTCAE by a group of multidisciplinary investigators and patient representatives and provides an overview of qualitative and quantitative studies of its measurement properties. A systematic evaluation of all 790 AEs listed in the CTCAE identified 78 appropriate for patient self-reporting. For each of these, a PRO-CTCAE plain language term in English and one to three items characterizing the frequency, severity, and/or activity interference of the AE were created, rendering a library of 124 PRO-CTCAE items. These items were refined in a cognitive interviewing study among patients on active cancer treatment with diverse educational, racial, and geographic backgrounds. Favorable measurement properties of the items, including construct validity, reliability, responsiveness, and between-mode equivalence, were determined prospectively in a demographically diverse population of patients receiving treatments for many different tumor types. A software platform was built to administer PRO-CTCAE items to clinical trial participants via the internet or telephone interactive voice response and was refined through usability testing. Work is ongoing to translate the PRO-CTCAE into multiple languages and to determine the optimal approach for integrating the PRO-CTCAE into clinical trial workflow and AE analyses. It is envisioned that the PRO-CTCAE will enhance the precision and patient-centeredness of adverse event reporting in cancer clinical research.},

abstract = {Background Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; also known as ERBB2), was investigated in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer. Methods ToGA (Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer) was an open-label, international, phase 3, randomised controlled trial undertaken in 122 centres in 24 countries. Patients with gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer were eligible for inclusion if their tumours showed overexpression of HER2 protein by immunohistochemistry or gene amplification by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a chemotherapy regimen consisting of capecitabine plus cisplatin or fluorouracil plus cisplatin given every 3 weeks for six cycles or chemotherapy in combination with intravenous trastuzumab. Allocation was by block randomisation stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, chemotherapy regimen, extent of disease, primary cancer site, and measurability of disease, implemented with a central interactive voice recognition system. The primary endpoint was overall survival in all randomised patients who received study medication at least once. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01041404. Findings 594 patients were randomly assigned to study treatment (trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, n=298; chemotherapy alone, n=296), of whom 584 were included in the primary analysis (n=294; n=290). Median follow-up was 18??6 months (IQR 11-25) in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy group and 17??1 months (9-25) in the chemotherapy alone group. Median overall survival was 13??8 months (95 CI 12-16) in those assigned to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy compared with 11??1 months (10-13) in those assigned to chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0??74; 95 CI 0??60-0??91; p=0??0046). The most common adverse events in both groups were nausea (trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, 197 [67] vs chemotherapy alone, 184 [63]), vomiting (147 [50] vs 134 [46]), and neutropenia (157 [53] vs 165 [57]). Rates of overall grade 3 or 4 adverse events (201 [68] vs 198 [68]) and cardiac adverse events (17 [6] vs 18 [6]) did not differ between groups. Interpretaion Trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy can be considered as a new standard option for patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer.

abstract = {Computational infrastructure for rep-resenting persons and citations has been avail-able in R for several years, but has been restruc-tured through enhanced classes "person" and "bibentry" in recent versions of R. The new features include support for the specification of the roles of package authors (e.g. maintainer, author, contributor, translator, etc.) and more flexible formatting/printing tools among vari-ous other improvements. Here, we introduce the new classes and their methods and indicate how this functionality is employed in the man-agement of R packages. Specifically, we show how the authors of R packages can be specified along with their roles in package 'DESCRIPTION' and/or 'CITATION' files and the citations pro-duced from it. R packages are the result of scholarly activity and as such constitute scholarly resources which must be clearly identifiable for the respective scientific com-munities and, more generally, today's information society. In particular, packages published by stan-dard repositories can be regarded as reliable sources which can and should be referenced (i.e. cited) by sci-entific works such as articles or other packages. This requires conceptual frameworks and computational infrastructure for describing bibliographic resources, general enough to encompass the needs of commu-nities with an interest in R. These needs include sup-port for exporting bibliographic metadata in stan-dardized formats such as BIBT E X (Berry and Patash-nik, 2010), but also facilitating bibliometric analyses and investigations of the social fabric underlying the creation of scholarly knowledge. The latter requires a richer vocabulary than com-monly employed by reference management software such as BIBT E X, identifying persons and their roles in relation to bibliographic resources. For example, a thesis typically has an author and advisors. Software can have an (original) author and a translator to an-other language (such as from S to R). The maintainer of an R package is not necessarily an author. In this paper, we introduce the base R infras-tructure (as completely available in R since version 2.14.0) for representing and manipulating such schol-arly data: objects of class "person" (hereafter, per-son objects) hold information about persons, possi-bly including their roles; objects of class "bibentry" (hereafter, bibentry objects) hold bibliographic infor-mation in enhanced BIBT E X style, ideally using per-son objects when referring to persons (such as au-thors or editors). Furthermore, we indicate how this functionality is employed in the management of R packages, in particular in their 'CITATION' and 'DESCRIPTION' files.},

abstract = {We describe an adaptive dose escalation scheme for use in cancer phase I clinical trials. The method is fully adaptive, makes use of all the information available at the time of each dose assignment, and directly addresses the ethical need to control the probability of overdosing. It is designed to approach the maximum tolerated dose as fast as possible subject to the constraint that the predicted proportion of patients who receive an overdose does not exceed a specified value. We conducted simulations to compare the proposed method with four up-and-down designs, two stochastic approximation methods, and with a variant of the continual reassessment method. The results showed the proposed method effective as a means to control the frequency of overdosing. Relative to the continual reassessment method, our scheme overdosed a smaller proportion of patients, exhibited fewer toxicities and estimated the maximum tolerated dose with comparable accuracy. When compared to the non-parametric schemes, our method treated fewer patients at either subtherapeutic or severely toxic dose levels, treated more patients at optimal dose levels and estimated the maximum tolerated dose with smaller average bias and mean squared error. Hence, the proposed method is promising alternative to currently used cancer phase I clinical trial designs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phase I trials often include a dose expansion cohort (DEC), in which additional patients are treated at the estimated maximum tolerated dose (MTD) after dose escalation, with the goal of ensuring that data are available from more than six patients at a single dose level. However, protocols do not always detail how, or even if, the additional toxicity data will be used to reanalyze the MTD or whether observed toxicity in the DEC will warrant changing the assigned dose. A DEC strategy has not been statistically justified.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We conducted a simulation study of two phase I designs: the "3+3" and the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM). We quantified how many patients are assigned the true MTD using a 10 to 20 patient DEC and how a sensible reanalysis using the DEC changes the probability of selecting the true MTD. We compared these results with those from an equivalently sized larger CRM that does not include a DEC.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: With either the 3+3 or CRM, reanalysis with the DEC increased the probability of identifying the true MTD. However, a large CRM without a DEC was more likely to identify the true MTD while still treating 10 or 15 patients at this dose level.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Where feasible, a CRM design with no explicit DEC is preferred to designs that fix a dose for all patients in a DEC.},

The method uses elicited (efficacy, toxicity) probability pairs to construct a family of trade-off contours that are used to quantify the desirability of each dose. This provides a basis for determining a best dose for each cohort. The method combines the goals of conventional Phase I and Phase II trials, and thus may be called a "Phase I-II" design. We first give a general review of the probability model and dose-finding algorithm. We next describe an application to a trial of a biologic agent for treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia, including a computer simulation study to assess the design's average behavior. To illustrate how the method may work in practice, we present a cohort-by-cohort example of a particular trial. We close with a discussion of some practical issues that may arise during implementation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although crossover trials enjoy wide use, standards for analysis and reporting have not been established. We reviewed methodological aspects and quality of reporting in a representative sample of published crossover trials. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE for December 2000 and identified all randomized crossover trials. We abstracted data independently, in duplicate, on 14 design criteria, 13 analysis criteria, and 14 criteria assessing the data presentation. RESULTS: We identified 526 randomized controlled trials, of which 116 were crossover trials. Trials were drug efficacy (48{\%}), pharmacokinetic (28{\%}), and nonpharmacologic (30{\%}). The median sample size was 15 (interquartile range 8-38). Most (72{\%}) trials used 2 treatments and had 2 periods (64{\%}). Few trials reported allocation concealment (17{\%}) or sequence generation (7{\%}). Only 20{\%} of trials reported a sample size calculation and only 31{\%} of these considered pairing of data in the calculation. Carry-over issues were addressed in 29{\%} of trial's methods. Most trials reported and defended a washout period (70{\%}). Almost all trials (93{\%}) tested for treatment effects using paired data and also presented details on by-group results (95{\%}). Only 29{\%} presented CIs or SE so that data could be entered into a meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: Reports of crossover trials frequently omit important methodological issues in design, analysis, and presentation. Guidelines for the conduct and reporting of crossover trials might improve the conduct and reporting of studies using this important trial design.},

@article{Fisher2012,
abstract = {An NINDS-sponsored conference in April of 2011 reviewed issues in epilepsy clinical trials. One goal was to clarify new electronic methods for recording seizure information and other data in clinical trials. This selective literature review and compilation of expert opinion considers advantages and limitations of traditional paper-based seizure diaries in comparison to electronic diaries. Seizure diaries are a type of patient-reported outcome. All seizure diaries depend first on accurate recognition and recording of seizures, which is a problem since about half of seizures recorded during video-EEG monitoring are not known to the patient. Reliability of recording is another key issue. Diaries may not be at hand after a seizure, lost or not brought to clinic visits. On-line electronic diaries have several potential advantages over paper diaries. Smartphones are increasingly accessible as data entry gateways. Data are not easily lost and are accessible from clinic. Entries can be time-stamped and provide immediate feedback, validation or reminders. Data can also can be graphed and pasted into an EMR. Disadvantages include need for digital sophistication, higher cost, increased setup time, and requiring attention to potential privacy issues. The Epilepsy Diary by epilepsy.com and Irody, Inc. has over 13,000 registrants and SeizureTracker over 10,000, and both are used for clinical and research purposes. Some studies have documented patient preference and increased compliance for electronic versus paper diaries. Seizure diaries can be challenging in the pediatric population. Children often have multiple seizure types and limited reporting of subjective symptoms. Multiple caregivers during the day require more training to produce reliable and consistent data. Diary-based observational studies have the advantages of low cost, allowing locus-of-control by the patient and testing in a "real-world" environment. Diary-based studies can also be useful as descriptive "snapshots" of a population. However, the type of information available is very different from that obtained by prospective controlled studies. The act of self-recording observations may itself influence the observation, for example, by causing the subject to attend more vigilantly to seizures after changing medication. Pivotal anti-seizure drug or device trials still mostly rely on paper-based seizure diaries. Industry is aware of the potential advantages of electronic diaries, particularly, the promise of real-time transmission of data, time-stamping of entries, reminders to subjects, and potentially automatic interfaces to other devices. However, until diaries are validated as research tools and the regulatory environment becomes clearer, adoption of new types of diaries as markers for a primary study outcome will be cautious. Recommendations from the conference included: further studies of validity of epilepsy diaries and how they can be used to improve adherence; use and further development of core data sets, such as the one recently developed by NINDS; encouraging links of diaries to electronic sensors; development of diary privacy and legal policies; examination of special pediatric diary issues; development of principles for observational research from diaries; and work with the FDA to make electronic diaries more useful in industry-sponsored clinical trials.

abstract = {Background: Patients with melanoma that progresses on ipilimumab and, if BRAFV600 mutant-positive, a BRAF or MEK inhibitor or both, have few treatment options. We assessed the efficacy and safety of two pembrolizumab doses versus investigator-choice chemotherapy in patients with ipilimumab-refractory melanoma. Methods: We carried out a randomised phase 2 trial of patients aged 18 years or older from 73 hospitals, clinics, and academic medical centres in 12 countries who had confirmed progressive disease within 24 weeks after two or more ipilimumab doses and, if BRAFV600 mutant-positive, previous treatment with a BRAF or MEK inhibitor or both. Patients had to have resolution of all ipilimumab-related adverse events to grade 0-1 and prednisone 10 mg/day or less for at least 2 weeks, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, and at least one measurable lesion to be eligible. Using a centralised interactive voice response system, we randomly assigned (1:1:1) patients in a block size of six to receive intravenous pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks or investigator-choice chemotherapy (paclitaxel plus carboplatin, paclitaxel, carboplatin, dacarbazine, or oral temozolomide). Randomisation was stratified by ECOG performance status, lactate dehydrogenase concentration, and BRAFV600 mutation status. Individual treatment assignment between pembrolizumab and chemotherapy was open label, but investigators and patients were masked to assignment of the dose of pembrolizumab. We present the primary endpoint at the prespecified second interim analysis of progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01704287. The study is closed to enrolment but continues to follow up and treat patients. Findings: Between Nov 30, 2012, and Nov 13, 2013, we enrolled 540 patients: 180 patients were randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 181 to receive pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 179 to receive chemotherapy.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Once-weekly gemcitabine concurrent with radiotherapy was highly effective in the treatment of head and neck cancer (HNC) but limited by high mucosal toxicity. Pre-clinical investigations suggested that delivering gemcitabine at substantially lower doses twice weekly during radiotherapy improved the therapeutic ratio. We sought to translated these preclinical findings to a phase I trial. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with non-resectable HNC were scheduled to receive gemcitabine twice weekly during the last 2 weeks (total 5 infusions) of hyperfractionated radiotherapy delivering 1.2 Gy twice daily to total 76.8 Gy. Tumor biopsies to measure active intracellular (phosphorylated) gemcitabine were planned after the first drug delivery. Patients were assigned to escalating dose cohorts using the Continuous Reassessment Method. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients evaluable for toxicity were divided into cohorts receiving twice weekly treatment with 10, 20, 33, or 50 mg/m2gemcitabine. Dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3-4 confluent mucositis/pharyngitis, and the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) was 20 mg/m2. Median survival was 20 months, with no difference between cohorts receiving lower (10, 20 mg/m2) or higher (33, 50 mg/m2) gemcitabine doses. Tumor biopsies after the first drug delivery showed only a minority of tumor cells in the specimens. CONCLUSION: These findings validate preclinical models that show that gemcitabine is radiation sensitizer at doses far below those used for systemic chemotherapy. However, the improvement in the therapeutic ratio predicted from the preclinical study did not translate into a substantial relative increase in the MTD of the drug in the clinical phase I trial. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

abstract = {Tan and Machin (biStat. Med. 2002; 21:1991-2012) introduce a Bayesian two-stage design for phase II clinical trials where the binary endpoint of interest is treatment efficacy. In this paper we propose an extension of their design to incorporate safety considerations. At each stage we define the treatment successful and deserving of further study if the total number of adverse events is sufficiently small and the number of responders who simultaneously do not experience any toxicity is sufficiently large. Therefore, our criterion is based on the joint posterior probability that the true overall toxicity rate and the true efficacy-and-safety rate are, respectively, smaller and larger than conveniently pre-specified target values. The optimal two-stage sample sizes are determined specifying a minimum threshold for the above-mentioned posterior probability, computed under the assumption that favorable outcomes have occurred. Besides describing the proposed design, we suggest how to construct informative prior scenarios and we also apply the reference algorithm to derive a non-informative prior distribution. Finally, some numerical results are provided and a real data application is illustrated.},

abstract = {Background: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare skin cancer. Cumulative data from retrospective series support the notion that benefits are obtained by both wide excision and adjuvant radiation therapy. However, surgery may be difficult to perform with tumors located in the head and neck region and/or in elderly patients with comorbidities incompatible with general anesthesia. Objective: We assessed the benefit of treating MCC exclusively with radiation when conventional treatment (surgery followed by radiotherapy) is not possible. Methods: A total of 25 patients with primary MCC were treated at our institution exclusively with radiotherapy. Because there is no consensus about this specific approach, we compared the recurrence rate of the 25 patients receiving radiotherapy alone with that of 25 patients who received conventional treatment at our institution. Results: The median follow-up periods were 3 years (range: 5 months-11 years) for the group receiving only radiotherapy (group 1) and 9 years (range: 12 months-16 years) for the conventional therapy group (group 2). No local relapses were observed, but two locoregional relapses were observed in group 1, and 4 in group 2. No statistical differences were found in overall and disease-free survival between the two groups of patients. Limitations: The limitation of this study is its retrospective nature. Conclusions: This study confirms the results of our previous research demonstrating that it is possible to treat inoperable MCC exclusively with radiotherapy to obtain an outcome similar to that which is achievable with conventional treatment. ?? 2010 by the American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.},

abstract = {A new analytic statistical technique for predictive event modeling in ongoing multicenter clinical trials with waiting time to response is developed. It allows for the predictive mean and predictive bounds for the number of events to be constructed over time, accounting for the newly recruited patients and patients already at risk in the trial, and for different recruitment scenarios. For modeling patient recruitment, an advanced Poisson-gamma model is used, which accounts for the variation in recruitment over time, the variation in recruitment rates between different centers and the opening or closing of some centers in the future. A few models for event appearance allowing for 'recurrence', 'death' and 'lost-to-follow-up' events and using finite Markov chains in continuous time are considered. To predict the number of future events over time for an ongoing trial at some interim time, the parameters of the recruitment and event models are estimated using current data and then the predictive recruitment rates in each center are adjusted using individual data and Bayesian re-estimation. For a typical scenario (continue to recruit during some time interval, then stop recruitment and wait until a particular number of events happens), the closed-form expressions for the predictive mean and predictive bounds of the number of events at any future time point are derived under the assumptions of Markovian behavior of the event progression. The technique is efficiently applied to modeling different scenarios for some ongoing oncology trials. Case studies are considered.},

abstract = {This paper looks at a new approach to the design and analysis of Phase 1 clinical trials in cancer. The basic idea and motivation behind the approach stem from an attempt to reconcile the needs of dose-finding experimentation with the ethical demands of established medical practice. It is argued that for these trials the particular shape of the dose toxicity curve is of little interest. Attention focuses rather on identifying a dose with a given targeted toxicity level and on concentrating experimentation at that which all current available evidence indicates to be the best estimate of this level. Such an approach not only makes an explicit attempt to meet ethical requirements but also enables the use of models whose only requirements are that locally (i.e., around the dose corresponding to the targeted toxicity level) they reasonably well approximate the true probability of toxic response. Although a large number of models could be contemplated, we look at a particularly simple one. Extensive simulations show the model to have real promise.},

It has been argued that it is more easily understood by practising physicians than more statistically based measures. In this paper we review the claims made for the NNT and question whether it is truly understandable to physicians, and look at issues around determining a confidence interval, or a Bayesian interval, for the NNT.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: ABL kinase domain mutations have been implicated in the resistance to the BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib mesylate of Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) leukemia patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and sequencing, we screened for ABL kinase domain mutations in 370 Ph+ patients with evidence of hematologic or cytogenetic resistance to imatinib. RESULTS: Mutations were found in 127 of 297 (43{\%}) evaluable patients. Mutations were found in 27{\%} of chronic-phase patients (14{\%} treated with imatinib frontline; 31{\%} treated with imatinib post-IFN failure), 52{\%} of accelerated-phase patients, 75{\%} of myeloid blast crisis patients, and 83{\%} of lymphoid blast crisis/Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Mutations were associated in 30{\%} of patients with primary resistance (44{\%} hematologic and 28{\%} cytogenetic) and in 57{\%} of patients with acquired resistance (23{\%} patients who lost cytogenetic response; 55{\%} patients who lost hematologic response; and 87{\%} patients who progressed to accelerated phase/blast crisis). P-loop and T315I mutations were particularly frequent in advanced-phase chronic myeloid leukemia and Ph+ ALL patients, and often accompanied progression from chronic phase to accelerated phase/blast crisis. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that (a) amino acid substitutions at seven residues (M244V, G250E, Y253F/H, E255K/V, T315I, M351T, and F359V) account for 85{\%} of all resistance-associated mutations; (b) the search for mutations is important both in case of imatinib failure and in case of loss of response at the hematologic or cytogenetic level; (c) advanced-phase chronic myeloid leukemia and Ph+ ALL patients have a higher likelihood of developing imatinib-resistant mutations; and (d) the presence of either P-loop or T315I mutations in imatinib-treated patients should warn the clinician to reconsider the therapeutic strategy.},

abstract = {The power of a chi-square test, and thus the required sample size, are a function of the noncentrality parameter that can be obtained as the limiting expectation of the test statistic under an alternative hypothesis specification. Herein, we apply this principle to derive simple expressions for two tests that are commonly applied to discrete ordinal data. The Wilcoxon rank sum test for the equality of distributions in two groups is algebraically equivalent to the Mann-Whitney test. The Kruskal-Wallis test applies to multiple groups. These tests are equivalent to a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel mean score test using rank scores for a set of C-discrete categories. Although various authors have assessed the power function of the Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests, herein it is shown that the power of these tests with discrete observations, that is, with tied ranks, is readily provided by the power function of the corresponding Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel mean scores test for two and R {\textgreater} 2 groups. These expressions yield results virtually identical to those derived previously for rank scores and also apply to other score functions. The Cochran-Armitage test for trend assesses whether there is an monotonically increasing or decreasing trend in the proportions with a positive outcome or response over the C-ordered categories of an ordinal independent variable, for example, dose. Herein, it is shown that the power of the test is a function of the slope of the response probabilities over the ordinal scores assigned to the groups that yields simple expressions for the power of the test.},

This is followed by brief outlines of what George Barnard considered were the four great systems of statistical inferences. These can be thought of terms of the four combinations of two factors at two levels. The first is fundamental pur-pose (decision or inference) and the second probability argument (direct or inverse). Of these four systems the 'fully Bayesian' approach of decision-making using inverse proba-bility particularly associated with the Ramsay, De Finetti, Savage and Lindley has some claims to be the most impressive. It is claimed, however, and illustrated by example, that this approach seems to be impossible to follow. It is speculated that there may be some advantage to the practising statistician to follow George Barnard's advice of being familiar with all four systems.},

abstract = {We revisit the problem of interval estimation of a binomial proportion. The erratic behavior of the coverage probability of the stan- dard Wald confidence interval has previously been remarked on in the literature (Blyth and Still, Agresti and Coull, Santner and others). We begin by showing that the chaotic coverage properties of the Wald inter- val are far more persistent than is appreciated. Furthermore, common textbook prescriptions regarding its safety are misleading and defective in several respects and cannot be trusted. This leads us to consideration of alternative intervals. A number of natural alternatives are presented, each with its motivation and con- text. Each interval is examined for its coverage probability and its length. Based on this analysis, we recommend the Wilson interval or the equal- tailed Jeffreys prior interval for small n and the interval suggested in Agresti and Coull for larger n. We also provide an additional frequentist justification for use of the Jeffreys interval},

abstract = {Background The past three decades have seen rapid improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of most cancers and the most important contributor has been research. Progress in rare cancers has been slower, not least because of the challenges of undertaking research. Settings The International Rare Cancers Initiative (IRCI) is a partnership which aims to stimulate and facilitate the development of international clinical trials for patients with rare cancers. It is focused on interventional - usually randomised - clinical trials with the clear goal of improving outcomes for patients. The key challenges are organisational and methodological. A multi-disciplinary workshop to review the methods used in ICRI portfolio trials was held in Amsterdam in September 2013. Other as-yet unrealised methods were also discussed. Results The IRCI trials are each presented to exemplify possible approaches to designing credible trials in rare cancers. Researchers may consider these for use in future trials and understand the choices made for each design. Interpretation Trials can be designed using a wide array of possibilities. There is no 'one size fits all' solution. In order to make progress in the rare diseases, decisions to change practice will have to be based on less direct evidence from clinical trials than in more common diseases.},

abstract = {Purpose Identification of sensitive biomarkers is essential to determine potential effects of emerging therapeutic trials for Stargardt disease. This study aimed to describe the natural history of late-onset Stargardt, and demonstrates the accuracy of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy progression as an outcome measure. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study collecting multicenter data from 47 patients (91 eyes) with late-onset Stargardt, defined by clinical phenotype, at least one ABCA4 mutation, and age at disease onset ≥ 45 years. We analyzed RPE atrophy progression on fundus autofluorescence and near-infrared reflectance imaging using semiautomated software and a linear mixed model. We performed sample size calculations to assess the power in a simulated 2-year interventional study and assessed visual endpoints using time-to-event analysis. Results Over time, progression of RPE atrophy was observed (mean: 0.22 mm/year, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 0.19-0.27). By including only patients with bilateral RPE atrophy in a future trial, 32 patients are needed to reach a power of 83.9{\%} (95{\%} CI: 83.1-84.6), assuming a fixed therapeutic effect size of 30{\%}. We found a median interval between disease onset and visual acuity decline to 20/32, 20/80, and 20/200 of 2.74 (95{\%} CI: 0.54-4.41), 10.15 (95{\%} CI: 6.13-11.38), and 11.38 (95{\%} CI: 6.13-13.34) years, respectively. Conclusions We show that RPE atrophy represents a robust biomarker to monitor disease progression in future therapeutic trials. In contrast, the variability in terms of the course of visual acuity was high.},

abstract = {Pilot studies for phase III trials - which are comparative randomized trials designed to provide preliminary evidence on the clinical efficacy of a drug or intervention - are routinely performed in many clinical areas. Also commonly know as "feasibility" or "vanguard" studies, they are designed to assess the safety of treatment or interventions; to assess recruitment potential; to assess the feasibility of international collaboration or coordination for multicentre trials; to increase clinical experience with the study medication or intervention for the phase III trials. They are the best way to assess feasibility of a large, expensive full-scale study, and in fact are an almost essential pre-requisite. Conducting a pilot prior to the main study can enhance the likelihood of success of the main study and potentially help to avoid doomed main studies. The objective of this paper is to provide a detailed examination of the key aspects of pilot studies for phase III trials including: 1) the general reasons for conducting a pilot study; 2) the relationships between pilot studies, proof-of-concept studies, and adaptive designs; 3) the challenges of and misconceptions about pilot studies; 4) the criteria for evaluating the success of a pilot study; 5) frequently asked questions about pilot studies; 7) some ethical aspects related to pilot studies; and 8) some suggestions on how to report the results of pilot investigations using the CONSORT format.},

Definitive evaluation of the clinical utility of these biomarkers requires conducting large randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Efficient RCT design is therefore crucial for timely introduction of these medical advances into clinical practice, and a variety of designs have been proposed for this purpose. To guide design and interpretation of RCTs evaluating biomarkers, we present an in-depth comparison of advantages and disadvantages of the commonly used designs. Key aspects of the discussion include efficiency comparisons and special interim monitoring issues that arise because of the complexity of these RCTs. Important ongoing and completed trials are used as examples. We conclude that, in most settings, randomized biomarker-stratified designs (ie, designs that use the biomarker to guide analysis but not treatment assignment) should be used to obtain a rigorous assessment of biomarker clinical utility.},

abstract = {Myelosuppression, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and relapse remain major causes of morbidity after stem cell transplantation for relapsed lymphoma. In this phase 1/2 study, we tested the safety and efficacy of escalating doses of bendamustine (70, 90, 110, and 130 mg/m2 per day for 3 days), coupled with our historical fixed doses of fludarabine and rituximab (BFR), as a nonmyeloablative allogeneic conditioning regimen for patients with relapsed lymphoma (n = 41) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (n = 15). Ten patients entered the phase 1 study; none experienced a dose-limiting toxicity. Forty-six additional patients were then treated in the phase 2 study at the maximum dose of 130 mg/m2 per day for 3 days. The proportions of transplants from matched siblings or unrelated donors were 54{\%} and 46{\%}. Remarkably, 55{\%} of patients did not experience severe neutropenia. Forty-nine patients (88{\%}) did not require platelet transfusion. The incidence of acute grade II-IV GVHD was 11{\%}. The 2-year rate of extensive chronic GVHD was 26{\%}. After a median follow-up duration of 26 months (range, 6-50 months), the 2-year overall and progression-free survival rates were 90{\%} and 75{\%}. In conclusion, our new BFR regimen is safe and effective for relapsed CLL and lymphoma patients.},

abstract = {Objective: Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor for the deterioration of open-angle glaucoma (OAG); medical IOP reduction is the standard treatment, yet no randomized placebo-controlled study of medical IOP reduction has been undertaken previously. The United Kingdom Glaucoma Treatment Study (UKGTS) tests the hypothesis that treatment with a topical prostaglandin analog, compared with placebo, reduces the frequency of visual field (VF) deterioration events in OAG patients by 50{\%} over a 2-year period. Design: The UKGTS is a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, multicenter treatment trial for OAG. Participants: Five hundred sixteen newly diagnosed (previously untreated) patients with OAG were recruited prospectively at 10 centers between 2007 and 2010. Methods: Patients were assigned by concealed telephone allocation to treatment with a prostaglandin analog (latanoprost 0.005{\%}) or placebo. The observation period was 2 years, with subjects monitored by VF testing, quantitative imaging, optic disc photography, and tonometry at 11 visits. Data were acquired according to novel protocols optimized for the analysis of deterioration velocity. The sample size was determined for a 2-sided error of $\alpha$ = 0.05 to detect the difference between 24{\%} and 11{\%} in incident deterioration over a 24-month follow-up at 90{\%} power and assuming a 25{\%} attrition rate. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was time to VF deterioration within 24 months. Secondary outcomes included the deterioration velocity of VF and quantitative imaging measures and the relationship between these velocities and risk factors for deterioration. Results: The study design enabled a short trial with a 2-year observation period and provided data that can be used to assess the feasibility of further shortening trial duration with the progression velocity of VF and structural imaging measurements as outcomes. Conclusions: The UKGTS is the first randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of medical treatment in reducing VF deterioration in OAG. The measurement of deterioration velocity and inclusion of quantitative imaging has the potential to reduce the number of patients and duration required for subsequent clinical trials. This trial also will quantify risk factors for deterioration, enabling more precise risk profiling of patients and the development of patient management protocols.

abstract = {We discuss an extension of the continual reassessment method (CRM) for use in phase I dose-finding studies. The extension enables the method to be applied to two groups of patients to determine the appropriate dose levels for each group. The method takes the specification of a simple relationship between the dose-toxicity curves for the two groups and runs the CRM on the bivariate model using maximum likelihood. We prove consistency of the method under fairly weak conditions and provide several simulations to give an idea how the method works in practice. We also undertake an evaluation of its performance by considering three possible situations: The first is the two-sample CRM, which directly uses a working model for the relationship between the two groups, carrying out a single trial using this method; the second situation carries out single trials for each of the two groups separately using the original (one-sample) CRM. The third situation is the case where such heterogeneity is ignored and the two groups are pooled into a single group, again using the original (one-sample) CRM. Simulations are carried out under a large class of model misspecifications, both of the dose-toxicity relationships and of the functional form linking the groups, and are backed up by asymptotic results. Our conclusions match intuition: The first scheme gives the most favorable results when the two groups are different but share some features. When the groups are very different, the second scheme performs similarly to the first for finite sample sizes while having some advantages in terms of asymptotic efficiency. The third, as expected, gives the best results in the absence of patient heterogeneity. The two-sample method appears particularly advantageous when there may not be enough subjects in one of the subgroups for it to be feasible to carry out two trials.},

abstract = {Background: The anti-programmed-death-receptor-1 (PD-1) antibody pembrolizumab has shown potent antitumour activity at different doses and schedules in patients with melanoma. We compared the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab at doses of 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks in patients with ipilimumab-refractory advanced melanoma. Methods: In an open-label, international, multicentre expansion cohort of a phase 1 trial, patients (aged ???18 years) with advanced melanoma whose disease had progressed after at least two ipilimumab doses were randomly assigned with a computer-generated allocation schedule (1:1 final ratio) to intravenous pembrolizumab at 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. Primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) assessed with the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1) by independent central review. Analysis was done on the full-analysis set (all treated patients with measurable disease at baseline). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01295827. Findings 173 patients received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg (n=89) or 10 mg/kg (n=84). Median follow-up duration was 8 months. ORR was 26{\%} at both doses - 21 of 81 patients in the 2 mg/kg group and 20 of 76 in the 10 mg/kg group (difference 0{\%}, 95{\%} CI -14 to 13; p=0??96). Treatment was well tolerated, with similar safety profiles in the 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg groups and no drug-related deaths. The most common drug-related adverse events of any grade in the 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg groups were fatigue (29 [33{\%}] vs 31 [37{\%}]), pruritus (23 [26{\%}] vs 16 [19{\%}]), and rash (16 [18{\%}] vs 15 [18{\%}]). Grade 3 fatigue, reported in five (3{\%}) patients in the 2 mg/kg pembrolizumab group, was the only drug-related grade 3 to 4 adverse event reported in more than one patient. Interpretation The results suggest that pembrolizumab at a dose of 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks might be an effective treatment in patients for whom there are few effective treatment options.},

@article{Garrett-Mayer2006,
abstract = {The Continual Reassessment Method (CRM), along with other adaptive dose-finding study designs, has gained popularity since its proposal by O'Quigley. Several of the reasons it has been embraced by clinical trialists is that it tends to incur fewer toxic events, and more accurately estimate the maximum tolerated dose as compared to the standard Phase I dose escalation designs. Many variations have been published and discussed in the statistical literature, but there has not been as much practical advice for choosing design parameters and implementing the CRM. As a result, the CRM has not been as widely utilized as it could be for dose-finding studies. The goal of this paper is to provide a tutorial for those unfamiliar with the CRM who are either statisticians considering using the CRM for the first time, or investigators with some statistical background. This paper presents the original CRM, and then some of its modified versions. It also explains the specifications that define a CRM design, along with simulated examples of CRMs and standard designs, for illustration.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Molecular characteristics of cancer vary between individuals. In future, most trials will require assessment of biomarkers to allocate patients into enriched populations in which targeted therapies are more likely to be effective. The MRC FOCUS3 trial is a feasibility study to assess key elements in the planning of such studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with advanced colorectal cancer were registered from 24 centres between February 2010 and April 2011. With their consent, patients' tumour samples were analysed for KRAS/BRAF oncogene mutation status and topoisomerase 1 (topo-1) immunohistochemistry. Patients were then classified into one of four molecular strata; within each strata patients were randomised to one of two hypothesis-driven experimental therapies or a common control arm (FOLFIRI chemotherapy). A 4-stage suite of patient information sheets (PISs) was developed to avoid patient overload. RESULTS A total of 332 patients were registered, 244 randomised. Among randomised patients, biomarker results were provided within 10 working days (w.d.) in 71{\%}, 15 w.d. in 91{\%} and 20 w.d. in 99{\%}. DNA mutation analysis was 100{\%} concordant between two laboratories. Over 90{\%} of participants reported excellent understanding of all aspects of the trial. In this randomised phase II setting, omission of irinotecan in the low topo-1 group was associated with increased response rate and addition of cetuximab in the KRAS, BRAF wild-type cohort was associated with longer progression-free survival. CONCLUSIONS Patient samples can be collected and analysed within workable time frames and with reproducible mutation results. Complex multi-arm designs are acceptable to patients with good PIS. Randomisation within each cohort provides outcome data that can inform clinical practice.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Recently, there has been a surge of early phase trials of molecularly targeted agents (MTAs) and immunotherapies. These new therapies have different toxicity profiles compared to cytotoxic therapies. MTAs can benefit from new trial designs that allow inclusion of low-grade toxicities, late-onset toxicities, addition of an efficacy endpoint, and flexibility in the specification of a target toxicity probability. To study the degree of adoption of these methods, we conducted a Web of Science search of articles published between 2008 and 2014 that describe phase 1 oncology trials. Trials were categorized based on the dose-finding design used and the type of drug studied. Out of 1,712 dose- finding trials that met our criteria, 1,591 (92.9{\%}) utilized a rule-based design, and 92 (5.4{\%}; range 2.3{\%} in 2009 to 9.7{\%} in 2014) utilized a model-based or novel design. Over half of the trials tested an MTA or immunotherapy.Among the MTA and immunotherapy trials, 5.8{\%} used model-based methods, com- pared to 3.9{\%} and 8.3{\%} of the chemotherapy or radiotherapy trials, respec- tively. While the percentage of trials using novel dose-finding designs has tripled since 2007, the adoption of these designs continues to remain low.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent clinical trial results have suggested that programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression measured by immunohistochemistry may predict response to anti–programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) therapy. Results on the association between PD-L1 expression and survival among patients with advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with chemotherapy are inconsistent. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated the relationship between PD-L1 expression and overall survival (OS) among 204 patients with advanced NSCLC treated at Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark, from 2007 to 2012. PD-L1 expression was measured using a prototype immunohistochemistry assay with the anti–PD-L1 22C3 antibody (Merck). PD-L1 strong positivity and weak positivity were defined to be traceable to the clinical trial version of the assay. RESULTS: Twenty-five percent of patients had PD-L1 strong-positive tumors, and 50{\%} had PD-L1 weak-positive tumors. No statistically significant association was found between PD-L1 expression and survival; adjusted hazard ratio of 1.34 (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.88-2.03; median OS, 9.0 months) for the PD-L1 strong-positive group and 1.07 (0.74- 1.55; median OS, 9.8 months) for the PD-L1 weak-positive group compared with the PD-L1–negative group (median OS, 7.5 months). No association was seen between PD-L1 expression and OS when PD-L1 expression levels were stratified by median or tertiles. CONCLUSIONS: In concordance with previous studies, we found PD-L1 measured by immunohistochemistry to be frequently expressed in patients with advanced NSCLC. However, PD-L1 expression is not a strong prognostic marker in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with chemotherapy.},

The dose sought is typically referred to as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Several statistical methodologies have been proposed to select the MTD in cancer phase I trials. In this manuscript, we focus on a Bayesian adaptive design, known as escalation with overdose control (EWOC). Several aspects of this design are discussed, including large sample properties of the sequence of doses selected in the trial, choice of prior distributions, and use of covariates. The methodology is exemplified with real-life examples of cancer phase I trials. In particular, we show in the recently completed ABR-217620 (naptumomab estafenatox) trial that omitting an important predictor of toxicity when dose assignments to cancer patients are determined results in a high percent of patients experiencing severe side effects and a significant proportion treated at sub-optimal doses.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE$\backslash$n$\backslash$nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of topiramate (100 mg/day) compared with placebo for the treatment of chronic migraine.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThis was a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study consisting of 16 weeks of double-blind treatment. Subjects aged 18 to 65 years with 15 or more headache days per month, at least half of which were migraine/migrainous headaches, were randomized 1:1 to either topiramate 100 mg/day or placebo. An initial dose of topiramate 25 mg/day (or placebo) was titrated upward in weekly increments of 25 mg/day to a maximum of 100 mg/day (or to the maximum tolerated dose). Concomitant preventive migraine treatment was not allowed, and acute headache medication use was not to exceed 4 days per week during the double-blind maintenance period. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in the mean monthly number of migraine/migrainous days; the change in the mean monthly number of migraine days also was analyzed. A fixed sequence approach (ie, gatekeeper approach) using analysis of covariance was used to analyze the efficacy endpoints. Assessments of safety and tolerability included physical and neurologic examinations, clinical laboratory parameters, and spontaneous reports of clinical adverse events.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe intent-to-treat population included 306 (topiramate, n = 153; placebo, n = 153) of 328 randomized subjects who provided at least 1 efficacy assessment; 55.8{\%} of the topiramate group and 55.2{\%} on placebo were trial completers. The mean final topiramate maintenance dose was 86.0 mg/day. The mean duration of therapy was 91.7 days for the topiramate group and 90.6 days for the placebo group. Topiramate treatment resulted in a statistically significant mean reduction of migraine/migrainous headache days (topiramate -6.4 vs placebo -4.7, P= .010) and migraine headache days relative to baseline (topiramate -5.6 vs placebo -4.1, P= .032). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 132 (82.5{\%}) and 113 (70.2{\%}) of topiramate-treated and placebo-treated subjects, respectively, and were generally of mild or moderate severity. Most commonly reported adverse events in the topiramate group were paresthesia (n = 46, 28.8{\%}), upper respiratory tract infection (n = 22, 13.8{\%}), and fatigue (n = 19, 11.9{\%}). The most common adverse events in the placebo group were upper respiratory tract infection (n = 20, 12.4{\%}), fatigue (n = 16, 9.9{\%}), and nausea (n = 13, 8.1{\%}). Discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in 18 (10.9{\%}) topiramate subjects and 10 (6.1{\%}) placebo subjects. There were no serious adverse events or deaths.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS$\backslash$n$\backslash$nTopiramate treatment at daily doses of approximately 100 mg resulted in statistically significant improvements compared with placebo in mean monthly migraine/migrainous and migraine headache days. Topiramate is safe and generally well tolerated in this group of subjects with chronic migraine, a burdensome condition with important unmet treatment needs. Safety and tolerability of topiramate were consistent with experience in previous clinical trials involving the drug.},

abstract = {In phase II cancer trials, tumour response is either the primary or an important secondary endpoint. Tumour response is a binary composite endpoint determined, according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, by (1) whether the percentage change in tumour size is greater than a prescribed threshold and (2) (binary) criteria such as whether a patient develops new lesions. Further binary criteria, such as death or serious toxicity, may be added to these criteria. The probability of tumour response (i.e. 'success' on the composite endpoint) would usually be estimated simply as the proportion of successes among patients. This approach uses the tumour size variable only through a discretised form, namely whether or not it is above the threshold. In this article, we propose a method that also estimates the probability of success but that gains precision by using the information on the undiscretised (i.e. continuous) tumour size variable. This approach can also be used to increase the power to detect a difference between the probabilities of success under two different treatments in a comparative trial. We demonstrate these increases in precision and power using simulated data. We also apply the method to real data from a phase II cancer trial and show that it results in a considerably narrower confidence interval for the probability of tumour response.},

Since a complete evaluation of an experimental therapy addresses both relative efficacy and relative toxicity, general methods for handling bivariate response data are of interest. A procedure for sequentially analysing both efficacy and toxicity data is presented. The procedure is designed to allow early termination due to efficacy results, toxicity results, or both. The method is based on modified marginal sequential analyses, accounting for bivariate correlated responses and multiple analyses over time. The theory is presented in the context of normally distributed responses. Extensions to bivariate failure time data are indicated and an example from a kidney transplant study demonstrates the procedure.},

abstract = {PURPOSE This phase I study evaluated the safety, maximum tolerated dose, antitumor activity, and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In a 3 + 3 dose escalation study, 10 patients received pembrolizumab 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks until progression or intolerable toxicity. Seven additional patients received 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Thirteen patients participated in a 3-week intrapatient dose escalation (dose range, 0.005-10 mg/kg) followed by 2 or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Tumor response was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. RESULTS No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Maximum administered dose was 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. One patient with melanoma and one with Merkel cell carcinoma experienced complete responses of 57 and 56+ weeks' duration, respectively. Three patients with melanoma experienced partial responses. Fifteen patients with various malignancies experienced stable disease. One patient died of cryptococcal infection 92 days after pembrolizumab discontinuation, following prolonged corticosteroid use for grade 2 gastritis considered drug related. Pembrolizumab exhibited pharmacokinetic characteristics typical of humanized monoclonal antibodies. Maximum serum target engagement was reached with trough levels of doses greater than or equal to 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Mechanism-based translational models with a focus on intratumor exposure prediction suggested robust clinical activity would be observed at doses ≥2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS Pembrolizumab was well tolerated and associated with durable antitumor activity in multiple solid tumors. The lowest dose with full potential for antitumor activity was 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks.},

Exclusion criteria were advanced visual field loss; mean IOP greater than 30 mmHg or any IOP greater than 35 mmHg; visual acuity less than 0.5; and inability to complete follow-up protocols. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERVENTIONS$\backslash$nAfter informed consent, patients were randomized to treatment or no initial treatment with close follow-up. Treated patients had laser trabeculoplasty and started receiving topical betaxolol twice daily in eligible eyes. Follow-up visits include computerized perimetry and tonometry every 3 months and fundus photography every 6 months. Decisions to change or begin treatment are made jointly with the patient when EMGT progression occurs and also later if clinically needed. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES$\backslash$nThe EMGT progression is defined by sustained increases of visual field loss in three consecutive C30-2 Humphrey tests, as determined from computer-based analyses, or by optic disc changes, as determined from flicker chronoscopy and side-by-side comparisons of fundus photographs performed by masked, independent graders. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS$\backslash$nA total of 255 patients were randomized between 1993 and 1997 and will be followed for at least 4 years.

A key feature of the Tool is that users can log in from different sites and view and interact with the same graphical displays, so that expert elicitation sessions can be conducted remotely (in conjunction with tele- or videoconferencing). This will make probability elicitation easier in situations where it is difficult to interview experts in person.

abstract = {The Common Data Element (CDE) Project was initiated in 2006 by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) to develop standards for performing funded neuroscience-related clinical research. CDEs are intended to standardize aspects of data collection; decrease study start-up time; and provide more complete, comprehensive, and equivalent data across studies within a particular disease area. Therefore, CDEs will simplify data sharing and data aggregation across NINDS-funded clinical research, and where appropriate, facilitate the development of evidenced-based guidelines and recommendations. Epilepsy-specific CDEs were established in nine content areas: (1) Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs) and Other Antiepileptic Therapies (AETs), (2) Comorbidities, (3) Electrophysiology, (4) Imaging, (5) Neurological Exam, (6) Neuropsychology, (7) Quality of Life, (8) Seizures and Syndromes, and (9) Surgery and Pathology. CDEs were developed as a dynamic resource that will accommodate recommendations based on investigator use, new technologies, and research findings documenting emerging critical disease characteristics. The epilepsy-specific CDE initiative can be viewed as part of the larger international movement toward "harmonization" of clinical disease characterization and outcome assessment designed to promote communication and research efforts in epilepsy. It will also provide valuable guidance for CDE improvement during further development, refinement, and implementation.

A wide range of response distributions are supported in combination with an intuitive and powerful multilevel formula syntax. Non-linear relationships may be specified using non-linear predictor terms, splines or Gaussian processes. Additionally, all parameters of the response distribution can be predicted at the same time allowing for distributional regression. Model fit can be investigated and compared using leave-one-out cross-validation and graphical posterior-predictive checks. Many more post-processing and plotting methods are implemented.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the use of the risk-adjusted sequential probability ratio test in monitoring the cumulative occurrence of adverse clinical outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of three longitudinal datasets. SUBJECTS: Patients aged 65 years and over under the care of Harold Shipman between 1979 and 1997, patients under 1 year of age undergoing paediatric heart surgery in Bristol Royal Infirmary between 1984 and 1995, adult patients receiving cardiac surgery from a team of cardiac surgeons in London,UK. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Annual and 30-day mortality rates. RESULTS: Using reasonable boundaries, the procedure could have indicated an 'alarm' in Bristol after publication of the 1991 Cardiac Surgical Register, and in 1985 or 1997 for Harold Shipman depending on the data source and the comparator. The cardiac surgeons showed no significant deviation from expected performance. CONCLUSIONS: The risk-adjusted sequential probability test is simple to implement, can be applied in a variety of contexts, and might have been useful to detect specific instances of past divergent performance. The use of this and related techniques deserves further attention in the context of prospectively monitoring adverse clinical outcomes.},

In the current report, the results for patients with CML in blast phase after 2 years of follow-up are reported.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Patients were stratified according to whether they had CML in myeloid blast phase (MBP-CML) or in lymphoid blast phase (LBP-CML) and were randomized (1:1) within each stratum to receive either oral dasatinib 140 mg once daily or 70 mg twice daily.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In patients with MBP-CML, the major hematologic response rate was 28{\%} for both regimens; and, in patients with LBP-CML, the major hematologic response rate was 42{\%} for once-daily dasatinib and 32{\%} for twice-daily dasatinib. The major cytogenetic response rates were 25{\%} for once-daily dasatinib and 28{\%} for twice-daily dasatinib in patients with MBP-CML, and the respective rates in patients with LBP-CML were 50{\%} and 40{\%}. The overall survival rate at 24 months was 24{\%} for once-daily dasatinib and 28{\%} for twice-daily dasatinib in patients with MBP-CML, and the respective values in patients with LBP-CML were 21{\%} and 16{\%}.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in surgery are complex to design and conduct and face unique challenges compared to trials in other specialties. The appropriate selection, measurement and reporting of outcomes are one aspect that requires attention. Outcomes in surgical RCTs are often ill-defined, inconsistent and at high risk of bias in their assessment and historically, there has been an undue focus on short-term outcomes and adverse events meaning the value of trial results for clinical practice and decision-making is limited.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPURPOSE: This review addresses three key problems with surgical trial outcomes-choosing the right outcomes for the trial design and purpose, selecting relevant outcomes to measure from the range of possible outcomes, and measuring outcomes with minimal risk of bias. Each obstacle is discussed in turn, highlighting some suggested solutions and current initiatives working towards improvements in these areas. Some examples of good practice in this field are also discussed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Many of the historical problems with surgical trial outcomes may be overcome with an increased understanding of the trial design and purpose and recognition that pragmatic trials require assessments of outcomes that are patient-centred in addition to measurement of short-term outcomes. The use of core outcome sets developed for specific surgical interventions and the application of novel methods to blind outcome assessors will also improve outcome measurement and reporting. It is recommended that surgeons work together with trial methodologists to integrate these approaches into RCTs in surgery. This will facilitate the appropriate evaluation of surgical interventions with informative outcomes so that results from trials can be useful for clinical practice.},

Objectives Following on from a previous study where we demonstrated good antibiofilm properties of acetic acid (AA), we assessed and compared the in vitro anti-biofilm activity of a range of AMDs and non-AMDs to AA. Methods Laboratory experiments determined the ability of a range of eleven commercial AMD, two nAMD, and AA, to prevent the formation of biofilms of a panel of four isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Results There is a large variation in ability of different dressings to inhibit biofilm formation, seen between dressings that contain the same, and those that contain other antimicrobial agents. The best performing AMD were Mepilex?? Ag and Acticoat. AA consistently prevented biofilm formation. Conclusions Large variation exists in the ability of AMD to prevent biofilm formation and colonisation of wounds. A standardised in vitro methodology should be developed for external parties to examine and compare the efficacies of commercially available AMDs, along with robust clinical randomised controlled trials. This is essential for informed clinical decision-making and optimal patient management.},

abstract = {Background: In a phase 2 study, dexpramipexole (25-150 mg twice daily) was well tolerated for up to 9 months and showed a significant benefit at the high dose in a combined assessment of function and mortality in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of dexpramipexole in a phase 3 trial of patients with familial or sporadic disease. Methods: In our randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial (EMPOWER), we enrolled participants aged 18-80 years (with first amyotrophic lateral sclerosis symptom onset 24 months or less before baseline) at 81 academic medical centres in 11 countries. We randomly allocated eligible participants (1:1) with a centralised voice-interactive online system to twice-daily dexpramipexole 150 mg or matched placebo for 12-18 months, stratified by trial site, area of disease onset (bulbar vs other areas), and previous use of riluzole. The primary endpoint was the combined assessment of function and survival (CAFS) score, based on changes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale-revised (ALSFRS-R) total scores and time to death up to 12 months. We assessed the primary endpoint in all participants who received at least one dose and had at least one post-dose ALSFRS-R measurement or died. We monitored adverse events in all participants. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01281189. Findings: Between March 28, 2011, and Sept 30, 2011, we enrolled 943 participants (474 randomly allocated dexpramipexole, 468 randomly allocated placebo, and one withdrew). Least-square mean CAFS scores at 12 months did not differ between participants in the dexpramipexole group (score 441{\textperiodcentered}76, 95{\%} CI 415{\textperiodcentered}43-468{\textperiodcentered}08) and those in the placebo group (438{\textperiodcentered}84, 412{\textperiodcentered}81-464{\textperiodcentered}88; p=0{\textperiodcentered}86). At 12 months, we noted no differences in mean change from baseline in ALSFRS-R total score (-13{\textperiodcentered}34 in the dexpramipexole group vs -13{\textperiodcentered}42 in the placebo group; p=0{\textperiodcentered}90) or time to death (74 [16{\%}] vs 79 [17{\%}]; hazard ratio 1{\textperiodcentered}03 [0{\textperiodcentered}75-1{\textperiodcentered}43]; p=0{\textperiodcentered}84). 37 (8{\%}) participants in the dexpramipexole group developed neutropenia compared with eight (2{\%}) participants in the placebo group, and incidence of other adverse events was similar between groups. Interpretation: Dexpramipexole was generally well tolerated but did not differ from placebo on any prespecified efficacy endpoint measurement.

abstract = {(Headache 2010;50:921-936) Objective.— To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX{\textregistered}) as headache prophylaxis in adults with chronic migraine. Background.— Chronic migraine is a prevalent, disabling, and undertreated neurological disorder. Few preventive treatments have been investigated and none is specifically indicated for chronic migraine. Methods.— The 2 multicenter, pivotal trials in the PREEMPT: Phase 3 REsearch Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Therapy clinical program each included a 24-week randomized, double-blind phase followed by a 32-week open-label phase (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT00156910, NCT00168428). Qualified patients were randomized (1:1) to onabotulinumtoxinA (155-195 U) or placebo injections every 12 weeks. Study visits occurred every 4 weeks. These studies were identical in design (eg, inclusion/exclusion criteria, randomization, visits, double-blind phase, open-label phase, safety assessments, treatment), with the only exception being the designation of the primary and secondary endpoints. Therefore, the predefined pooling of the results was justified and performed to provide a complete overview of between-group differences in efficacy, safety, and tolerability that may not have been evident in individual studies. The primary endpoint for the pooled analysis was mean change from baseline in frequency of headache days at 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints were mean change from baseline to week 24 in frequency of migraine/probable migraine days, frequency of moderate/severe headache days, total cumulative hours of headache on headache days, frequency of headache episodes, frequency of migraine/probable migraine episodes, frequency of acute headache pain medication intakes, and the proportion of patients with severe (≥60) Headache Impact Test-6 score at week 24. Results of the pooled analyses of the 2 PREEMPT double-blind phases are presented. Results.— A total of 1384 adults were randomized to onabotulinumtoxinA (n = 688) or placebo (n = 696). Pooled analyses demonstrated a large mean decrease from baseline in frequency of headache days, with statistically significant between-group differences favoring onabotulinumtoxinA over placebo at week 24 (−8.4 vs −6.6; P {\textless} .001) and at all other time points. Significant differences favoring onabotulinumtoxinA were also observed for all secondary efficacy variables at all time points, with the exception of frequency of acute headache pain medication intakes. Adverse events occurred in 62.4{\%} of onabotulinumtoxinA patients and 51.7{\%} of placebo patients. Most patients reported adverse events that were mild to moderate in severity and few discontinued (onabotulinumtoxinA, 3.8{\%}; placebo, 1.2{\%}) due to adverse events. No unexpected treatment-related adverse events were identified. Conclusions.— The pooled PREEMPT results demonstrate that onabotulinumtoxinA is an effective prophylactic treatment for chronic migraine. OnabotulinumtoxinA resulted in significant improvements compared with placebo in multiple headache symptom measures, and significantly reduced headache-related disability and improved functioning, vitality, and overall health-related quality of life. Repeat treatments with onabotulinumtoxinA were safe and well tolerated.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Knowledge of the placebo outcomes and understanding specific study features that influence these outcomes is important for designing future clinical trials evaluating therapy of ulcerative colitis (UC). The aims of this study were to estimate the placebo rates of remission and response in placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials for active UC and to identify factors influencing these rates. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials evaluating therapies for active UC identified from MEDLINE from 1966 through 2005. Results: Forty studies met the inclusion criteria. The pooled estimates of the placebo rates of remission and response were 13{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 9{\%}-18{\%}; range, 0{\%}-40{\%}; median, 12{\%}) and 28{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 23{\%}-33{\%}; range, 0{\%}-67{\%}; median, 30{\%}), respectively, both with significant heterogeneity. Studies that used more stringent definitions of outcomes had lower placebo rates of remission and response. Study duration, number of study visits, disease duration, baseline composite and rectal bleeding scores of the disease activity index, and inclusion of endoscopic mucosal healing as the remission definition all were associated with the placebo remission rate. Conclusions: Rates of remission in the placebo arm of UC clinical trials ranges from 0{\%} to 40{\%}. The placebo remission rates are influenced by the trial length, number of study visits, use of stricter remission definitions, and design features that enroll patients with more active disease. These factors should be considered when designing future placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with active UC. ?? 2007 AGA Institute.},

However, there is a need for even shorter measures, which reduce respondent burden. The developers of the SF-36 have consequently suggested that a 12-item sub-set of the items may accurately reproduce the two summary component scores which can be derived from the SF-36 [the Physical Component Summary Score (PCS) and Mental Health Component Summary Score (MCS)]. In this paper, we adopt scoring algorithms for the UK SF-36 and SF-12 summary scores to evaluate the picture of change gained in various treatment groups.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The SF-36 was administered in three treatment groups (ACE inhibitors for congestive heart failure, continuous positive airways therapy for sleep apnoea, and open vs laparoscopic surgery for inguinal hernia).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: PCS and MCS scores calculated from the SF-36 or a sub-set of 12 items (the 'SF-12') were virtually identical, and indicated the same magnitude of ill-health and degree of change over time.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The results suggest that where two summary scores of health status are adequate than the SF-12 may be the instrument of choice.},

Here, we implement the TITE-CRM in dose–finding trials of combinations of agents. When studying multiple agents, monotonicity of the dose-toxicity curve is not clearly defined. Therefore, the toxicity probabilities follow a partial order, meaning that there are pairs of treatments for which the ordering of the toxicity probabilities is not known at the start of the trial. A CRM design for partially ordered trials (PO-CRM) was recently proposed. Simulation studies show that extending the TITE-CRM to the partial order setting produces results similar to those of the PO-CRM in terms of maximum tolerated dose recommendation yet reduces the duration of the trial.},

abstract = {You have just finished running an experiment. You ana-lyze the results, and you find a significant effect. Success! But wait—how much information does your study really give you? How much should you trust your results? In this article, we show that when researchers use small samples and noisy measurements to study small effects—as they often do in psychology as well as other disciplines—a significant result is often surprisingly likely to be in the wrong direction and to greatly overestimate an effect. In this article, we examine some critical issues related to power analysis and the interpretation of findings aris-ing from studies with small sample sizes. We highlight the use of external information to inform estimates of true effect size and propose what we call a design anal-ysis—a set of statistical calculations about what could happen under hypothetical replications of a study—that focuses on estimates and uncertainties rather than on sta-tistical significance. As a reminder, the power of a statistical test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis. For any experimental design, the power of a study depends on sample size, measurement variance, the number of comparisons being performed, and the size of the effects being studied. In general, the larger the effect, the higher the power; thus, power calculations are per-formed conditionally on some assumption of the size of the effect. Power calculations also depend on other assumptions, most notably the size of measurement error, but these are typically not so difficult to assess with avail-able data. It is of course not at all new to recommend the use of statistical calculations on the basis of prior guesses of effect sizes to inform the design of studies. What is new about the present article is as follows: 1. We suggest that design calculations be performed after as well as before data collection and analysis.},

abstract = {Oncology has the highest number of drug development failures, which calls for improvement in drug development methodology [1]. Following the two therapeutic revolutions of targeted agents and immune therapies, several drug development paradigms have been challenged, including the systematic recommendation of the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) as recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) [2]. More and more trials seek to determine the " optimal biological dose " (dose associated with the most desirable effect on a pre-specified biomarker). Further, although determination of safety profile of a new agent remains the primary endpoint of phase 1 trials, efficacy is more and more often brought forward as a co-primary endpoint. This has resulted in significant transformations over the last few years, with phase 1 samples sizes and number of expansion cohorts being multiplied [3]. Such expansion cohorts are sometimes disguised single arm phase 2 studies, resulting in a two-step design made of a dose-escalation phase, based on toxicity only, followed by a " signal-searching " expansion phase with stopping rules for futility [4]. In this context, should we take into account efficacy to guide dose-escalation and dose-recommendation? In this issue of Annals of Oncology, Yan and colleagues [5] illustrate, using clear examples, that responses at doses other than the RP2D are not integrated in the overall efficacy evaluation, and propose the phase 1-2 EffTox model-based design, which utilizes both toxicity and efficacy data to guide dose-recommendation. Doses are escalated if the agent is safe and if more activity is expected; doses are de-escalated if lower doses appear almost equally active but less toxic; agents without sufficient activity at any safe dose are halted early. Dose that allows reaching the optimal efficacy-toxicity trade-off is further selected.},

Two drugs, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, are now FDA approved for use in certain patients who have failed or progressed on platinum-based or targeted therapies while agents targeting PD-L1, atezolizumab and durvalumab, are approaching the final stages of clinical testing.

abstract = {Purpose The measurement properties of the EQ-5D have not been explored for patients with traumatic limb injuries. The purpose of this study was to examine the construct validity, predictive validity, and responsiveness of the EQ-5D in patients with traumatic limb injuries. Methods A consecutive cohort of 1,167 patients was assessed with the EQ-5D and the World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument (WHOQOL-BREF) at baseline while the patients were hospitalized because of the injury, and the patients were followed up at 3 months (1,003 patients), 6 months (1,010 patients), and 12 months (987 patients) after injury via telephone interview. Results The utility and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores of the EQ-5D had moderate to high association with the physical and psychological domains and the two general questions (overall QOL and overall health) of the WHOQOL-BREF at all time points except baseline (Pearson's correlation coefficient {\textgreater}0.3), but the EQ-5D profiles were weakly associated with the social and environment domains of the WHOQOL-BREF (absolute value of Spearman's correlation coefficient {\textless}0.3). These results indicate that the EQ-5D has satisfactory construct validity. The utility and VAS scores of the EQ-5D at 3 and 6 months after injury can predict (with moderate to large relationships) the four domains and two general questions of the WHOQOL-BREF administered at 12 months after injury. The responsiveness of the utility and VAS of the EQ-5D were high (effect sizes {\textgreater}0.9) at 0-3, 0-6, and 0-12 months after injury. Conclusions The EQ-5D has sufficient construct validity, predictive validity, and responsiveness, and also provides evidence for using the utility of the EQ-5D for cost-utility analyses of patients with traumatic limb injuries in the future.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Minimisation of the placebo responses in randomised controlled trials [RCTs] is essential for efficient evaluation of new interventions. Placebo rates have been high in ulcerative colitis [UC] clinical trials, and factors influencing this are poorly understood. We quantify placebo response and remission rates in UC RCTs and identify trial design factors influencing them. METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception through April 2014 for placebo-controlled trials in adult patients with UC of a biological agent, corticosteroid, immunosuppressant, or aminosalicylate. Data were independently doubly extracted. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS In all, 51 trials [48 induction and 10 maintenance phases] were identified. Placebo response and remission rates were pooled according to random-effects models, and mixed-effects meta-regression models were used to evaluate effects of study-level characteristics on these rates. Pooled estimates of placebo remission and response rates for induction trials were 10{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 7-13{\%}) and 33{\%} [95{\%} CI 29-37{\%}], respectively. Corresponding values for maintenance trials were 19{\%} [95{\%} CI 11-30{\%}] and 22{\%} [95{\%} CI 17-28{\%}]. Trials enrolling patients with more active disease confirmed by endoscopy [endoscopy subscore ≥ 2] were associated with lower placebo rates. Conversely, placebo rates increased with increasing trial duration and number of study visits. CONCLUSIONS Objective assessment of greater disease activity at trial entry by endoscopy lowered placebo rates, whereas increasing trial duration and more interactions with healthcare providers increased placebo rates. These findings have important implications for design and conduct of clinical trials.},

abstract = {This study aimed to investigate whether paranoid experiences and levels of self-esteem fluctuate over the menstrual cycle and whether levels of self-esteem are lower when perceived persecution is felt to be deserved. Measures of anxiety, depression, persecution, deservedness and self-esteem were completed on-line by 278 women over their menstrual cycle. Responses were compared at the paramenstrual (3 days before and after menses onset) and mid-cycle phase. At the paramenstrual phase persecution, negative self-esteem, anxiety and depression were higher and positive self-esteem was lower than at mid-cycle. A greater proportion of women experienced persecution as deserved at the paramenstrual phase. This was associated with higher depression and negative self-esteem scores. Increased levels of deservedness significantly strengthened the relationship between persecution and negative, but not positive, self-esteem. These findings suggest that the paramenstrual phase is a time of vulnerability to increased paranoid experiences, an increased likelihood that feelings of persecution will feel deserved and lowered self-esteem. The findings support the view that interpersonal sensitivities may be key to menstrual cycle symptoms and have an impact on relationships. Further, the study illustrated that ideas developed for psychosis could make a valuable contribution to understanding and managing this aspect of menstruation-related distress.},

This systematic review examines the different methods and instruments used to assess QoL in this condition from which recommendations are made of those that evidence suggests are the most appropriate. Databases were used to survey the available literature to cover as many different approaches and papers as possible. Due to the wide variety of approaches to the measurement of QoL data across the papers, no meta-analysis was possible. The available evidence suggests that at the present time the most appropriate measures are the SF-36, a generic widely used QoL measure, and the disease specific ALSAQ-40. However, as many of the validation studies on the ALSAQ-40 were undertaken by the developers of this instrument, further independent research is desirable to confirm these conclusions.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Acetazolamide is commonly used to treat idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), but there is insufficient information to establish an evidence base for its use. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether acetazolamide is beneficial in improving vision when added to a low-sodium weight reduction diet in patients with IIH and mild visual loss. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study of acetazolamide in 165 participants with IIH and mild visual loss who received a low-sodium weight-reduction diet. Participants were enrolled at 38 academic and private practice sites in North America from March 2010 to November 2012 and followed up for 6 months (last visit in June 2013). All participants met the modified Dandy criteria for IIH and had a perimetric mean deviation (PMD) between -2 dB and -7 dB. The mean age was 29 years and all but 4 participants were women. INTERVENTIONS: Low-sodium weight-reduction diet plus the maximally tolerated dosage of acetazolamide (up to 4 g/d) or matching placebo for 6 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The planned primary outcome variable was the change in PMD from baseline to month 6 in the most affected eye, as measured by Humphrey Field Analyzer. Perimetric mean deviation is a measure of global visual field loss (mean deviation from age-corrected normal values), with a range of 2 to -32 dB; larger negative values indicate greater vision loss. Secondary outcome variables included changes in papilledema grade, quality of life (Visual Function Questionnaire 25 [VFQ-25] and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey), headache disability, and weight at month 6. RESULTS: The mean improvement in PMD was greater with acetazolamide (1.43 dB, from -3.53 dB at baseline to -2.10 dB at month 6; n = 86) than with placebo (0.71 dB, from -3.53 dB to -2.82 dB; n = 79); the difference was 0.71 dB (95{\%} CI, 0 to 1.43 dB; P = .050). Mean improvements in papilledema grade (acetazolamide: -1.31, from 2.76 to 1.45; placebo: -0.61, from 2.76 to 2.15; treatment effect, -0.70; 95{\%} CI, -0.99 to -0.41; P {\textless} .001) and vision-related quality of life as measured by the National Eye Institute VFQ-25 (acetazolamide: 8.33, from 82.97 to 91.30; placebo: 1.98, from 82.97 to 84.95; treatment effect, 6.35; 95{\%} CI, 2.22 to 10.47; P = .003) and its 10-item neuro-ophthalmic supplement (acetazolamide: 9.82, from 75.45 to 85.27; placebo: 1.59, from 75.45 to 77.04; treatment effect, 8.23; 95{\%} CI, 3.89 to 12.56; P {\textless} .001) were also observed with acetazolamide. Participants assigned to acetazolamide also experienced a reduction in weight (acetazolamide: -7.50 kg, from 107.72 kg to 100.22 kg; placebo: -3.45 kg, from 107.72 kg to 104.27 kg; treatment effect, -4.05 kg, 95{\%} CI, -6.27 to -1.83 kg; P {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients with IIH and mild visual loss, the use of acetazolamide with a low-sodium weight-reduction diet compared with diet alone resulted in modest improvement in visual field function. The clinical importance of this improvement remains to be determined. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01003639.},

abstract = {Background Incisional hernia is a frequent complication of midline laparotomy and is associated with high morbidity, decreased quality of life, and high costs. We aimed to compare the large bites suture technique with the small bites technique for fascial closure of midline laparotomy incisions. Methods We did this prospective, multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial at surgical and gynaecological departments in ten hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients aged 18 years or older who were scheduled to undergo elective abdominal surgery with midline laparotomy were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated randomisation sequence, to receive small tissue bites of 5 mm every 5 mm or large bites of 1 cm every 1 cm. Randomisation was stratified by centre and between surgeons and residents with a minimisation procedure to ensure balanced allocation. Patients and study investigators were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was the occurrence of incisional hernia; we postulated a reduced incidence in the small bites group. We analysed patients by intention to treat. This trial is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT01132209 and with the Nederlands Trial Register, number NTR2052. Findings Between Oct 20, 2009, and March 12, 2012, we randomly assigned 560 patients to the large bites group (n=284) or the small bites group (n=276). Follow-up ended on Aug 30, 2013; 545 (97{\%}) patients completed follow-up and were included in the primary outcome analysis. Patients in the small bites group had fascial closures sutured with more stitches than those in the large bites group (mean number of stitches 45 [SD 12] vs 25 [10]; p{\textless}0??0001), a higher ratio of suture length to wound length (5??0 [1??5] vs 4??3 [1??4]; p{\textless}0??0001) and a longer closure time (14 [6] vs 10 [4] min; p{\textless}0??0001). At 1 year follow-up, 57 (21{\%}) of 277 patients in the large bites group and 35 (13{\%}) of 268 patients in the small bites group had incisional hernia (p=0??0220, covariate adjusted odds ratio 0??52, 95{\%} CI 0??31-0??87; p=0??0131). Rates of adverse events did not differ significantly between groups. Interpretation Our findings show that the small bites suture technique is more effective than the traditional large bites technique for prevention of incisional hernia in midline incisions and is not associated with a higher rate of adverse events. The small bites technique should become the standard closure technique for midline incisions. Funding Erasmus University Medical Center and Ethicon.},

PATIENTS AND METHODSIn a multicenter phase III randomized trial, patients with advanced NSCLC, ECOG PS of 2, any histology at first and later amended to nonsquamous only, no prior chemotherapy, and adequate organ function were randomly assigned to P alone (500 mg/m(2)) or CP (area under the curve of 5 and 500 mg/m(2), respectively) administered every 3 weeks for a total of four cycles. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).ResultsA total of 205 eligible patients were enrolled from eight centers in Brazil and one in the United States from April 2008 to July 2011. The response rates were 10.3{\%} for P and 23.8{\%} for CP (P = .032). In the intent-to-treat population, the median PFS was 2.8 months for P and 5.8 months for CP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95{\%} CI, 0.35 to 0.63; P {\textless} .001), and the median OS was 5.3 months for P and 9.3 months for CP (HR, 0.62; 95{\%} CI, 0.46 to 0.83; P = .001). One-year survival rates were 21.9{\%} and 40.1{\%}, respectively. Similar results were seen when patients with squamous disease were excluded from the analysis. Anemia (grade 3, 3.9{\%}; grade 4, 11.7{\%}) and neutropenia (grade 3, 1{\%}; grade 4, 6.8{\%}) were more frequent with CP. There were four treatment-related deaths in the CP arm. CONCLUSIONCombination chemotherapy with CP significantly improves survival in patients with advanced NSCLC and ECOG PS of 2.},

There is therefore an increasing need to identify methods to assess interventions that are sufficiently robust to potentially affect clinical practice in this setting. Methods advocated for clinical trials in rare diseases are not necessarily applicable in rare cancers. This Series paper describes research methods that are relevant for rare cancers in relation to the sliding scale [A: please clarify this concept in the text] of rarity. Strategies that maximise recruitment, minimise sample size, or maximise the usefulness of the evidence could enable the application of conventional clinical trial design to rare cancer populations. Alternative designs that address specific challenges for rare cancers with the aim of potentially changing clinical practice include Bayesian designs, uncontrolled n-of-1 trials, and umbrella and basket trials. Pragmatic solutions must be sought to enable some level of evidence-based health care for patients with rare cancers.},

This review summarises the key literature from pre-clinical models that underlies our understanding of innate inflammation following traumatic brain injury before focussing on the growing evidence from human studies. In addition, the underlying molecular mediators responsible for blood brain barrier dysfunction have been discussed. In particular, we have highlighted the different sampling methodologies available and the difficulties in interpreting human data of this sort. Ultimately, understanding the innate inflammatory response to traumatic brain injury may provide a therapeutic avenue in the treatment of central nervous system disease. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Although sample size calculations have become an important element in the design of research projects, such methods for studies involving current status data are scarce. Here, we propose a method for calculating power and sample size for studies using current status data. This method is based on a Weibull survival model for a two-group comparison. The Weibull model allows the investigator to specify a group difference in terms of a hazards ratio or a failure time ratio. We consider exponential, Weibull and uniformly distributed censoring distributions. We base our power calculations on a parametric approach with the Wald test because it is easy for medical investigators to conceptualize and specify the required input variables. As expected, studies with current status data have substantially less power than studies with the usual right-censored failure time data. Our simulation results demonstrate the merits of these proposed power calculations.},

abstract = {Reducing the number of patients required for a clinical trial is important for shortening development time. Phase II cancer trials assess the tumour-shrinking effect of a novel compound through a binary end-point formed from the percentage change in total lesion diameter. We compare single-arm two-stage designs which use the binary end-point to those which directly use the continuous end-point. Using the continuous end-point results in lower expected and maximum sample sizes. For larger trials the reduction is around 37{\%}. This assumes that the dichotomisation point of the continuous end-point is chosen to give the best sample size, with the trial design using the binary end-point performing even worse otherwise. We consider a previous trial designed using a Simon two-stage design and show that if the continuous end-point had been used, the expected and maximum sample sizes of the trial would be reduced by around 50{\%}. Using the continuous end-point in a two-stage cancer trial results in large sample size reductions. The methods discussed in this paper work best when the number of complete responses is low, as is true in several types of cancer. We discuss what could be done if this is not the case. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The management of NSCLC has been transformed by stratified medicine. The National Lung Matrix Trial (NLMT) is a UK-wide study exploring the activity of rationally selected biomarker/targeted therapy combinations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Cancer Research UK (CRUK) Stratified Medicine Programme 2 is undertaking the large volume national molecular pre-screening which integrates with the NLMT. At study initiation, there are eight drugs being used to target 18 molecular cohorts. The aim is to determine whether there is sufficient signal of activity in any drug-biomarker combination to warrant further investigation. A Bayesian adaptive design that gives a more realistic approach to decision making and flexibility to make conclusions without fixing the sample size was chosen. The screening platform is an adaptable 28-gene Nextera next-generation sequencing platform designed by Illumina, covering the range of molecular abnormalities being targeted. The adaptive design allows new biomarker-drug combination cohorts to be incorporated by substantial amendment. The pre-clinical justification for each biomarker-drug combination has been rigorously assessed creating molecular exclusion rules and a trumping strategy in patients harbouring concomitant actionable genetic abnormalities. Discrete routes of pathway activation or inactivation determined by cancer genome aberrations are treated as separate cohorts. Key translational analyses include the deep genomic analysis of pre- and post-treatment biopsies, the establishment of patient-derived xenograft models and longitudinal ctDNA collection, in order to define predictive biomarkers, mechanisms of resistance and early markers of response and relapse. CONCLUSION: The SMP2 platform will provide large scale genetic screening to inform entry into the NLMT, a trial explicitly aimed at discovering novel actionable cohorts in NSCLC.

We also sought to define and validate an expression level of the PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) that is associated with the likelihood of clinical benefit. METHODS We assigned 495 patients receiving pembrolizumab (at a dose of either 2 mg or 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 3 weeks or 10 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks) to either a training group (182 patients) or a validation group (313 patients). We assessed PD-L1 expression in tumor samples using immunohistochemical analysis, with results reported as the percentage of neoplastic cells with staining for membranous PD-L1 (proportion score). Response was assessed every 9 weeks by central review. RESULTS Common side effects that were attributed to pembrolizumab were fatigue, pruritus, and decreased appetite, with no clear difference according to dose or schedule. Among all the patients, the objective response rate was 19.4{\%}, and the median duration of response was 12.5 months. The median duration of progression-free survival was 3.7 months, and the median duration of overall survival was 12.0 months. PD-L1 expression in at least 50{\%} of tumor cells was selected as the cutoff from the training group. Among patients with a proportion score of at least 50{\%} in the validation group, the response rate was 45.2{\%}. Among all the patients with a proportion score of at least 50{\%}, median progression-free survival was 6.3 months; median overall survival was not reached. CONCLUSIONS Pembrolizumab had an acceptable side-effect profile and showed antitumor activity in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. PD-L1 expression in at least 50{\%} of tumor cells correlated with improved efficacy of pembrolizumab. (Funded by Merck; KEYNOTE-001 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01295827.).},

Opinions vary on best practice, and most procedures have considerable morbidity and high recurrence rates of 6-40{\%}. OBJECTIVES: This study systematically reviews the use of fibrin glue in the treatment of pilonidal disease. Outcomes measured were healing time and recurrence rate. DATA SOURCE: ScienceDirect and PubMed databases were searched for relevant literature, yielding seven papers including five small trials. The total number of patients receiving fibrin glue treatments across all trials was 85. There were no exclusion criteria in this review. RESULTS: Fibrin glue treatments had equivalent or better reported healing times than conventional therapies at an average of 2-6 weeks, and low recurrence rates between 0 and 17{\%} at follow-up periods between 4 and 28 months. Considerable heterogeneity in study methodologies and surgical techniques prevented statistical significance or aggregate figures from being determined. CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be early promise for the use of fibrin glue in the treatment of pilonidal disease and an impetus for definitive research.Copyright 2011 The Author.

abstract = {Phase II study designs are proposed that evaluate both clinical response and toxicity, and that are similar in structure to Simon's two-stage designs. Sample sizes and decision criteria are chosen to minimize the maximum expected accrual, given that the treatment is unacceptable either in terms of clinical response or toxicity. This is achieved subject to control of error rates, either uniformly over all possible correlation structures linking response and toxicity, or alternatively, under an assumption of independence between response and toxicity. In the latter case, bounds on the error rates show that effective control is still uniformly achieved even if the independence assumption is relaxed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell effector mechanisms that limits immune responses against cancer. We tested the anti-PD-1 antibody lambrolizumab (previously known as MK-3475) in patients with advanced melanoma.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We administered lambrolizumab intravenously at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 or 3 weeks or 2 mg per kilogram every 3 weeks in patients with advanced melanoma, both those who had received prior treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab and those who had not. Tumor responses were assessed every 12 weeks.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 135 patients with advanced melanoma were treated. Common adverse events attributed to treatment were fatigue, rash, pruritus, and diarrhea; most of the adverse events were low grade. The confirmed response rate across all dose cohorts, evaluated by central radiologic review according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, was 38{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 25 to 44), with the highest confirmed response rate observed in the cohort that received 10 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks (52{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 38 to 66). The response rate did not differ significantly between patients who had received prior ipilimumab treatment and those who had not (confirmed response rate, 38{\%} [95{\%} CI, 23 to 55] and 37{\%} [95{\%} CI, 26 to 49], respectively). Responses were durable in the majority of patients (median follow-up, 11 months among patients who had a response); 81{\%} of the patients who had a response (42 of 52) were still receiving treatment at the time of analysis in March 2013. The overall median progression-free survival among the 135 patients was longer than 7 months.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced melanoma, including those who had had disease progression while they had been receiving ipilimumab, treatment with lambrolizumab resulted in a high rate of sustained tumor regression, with mainly grade 1 or 2 toxic effects.

abstract = {Importance Minimal residual disease (MRD) refers to the presence of disease in cases deemed to be in complete remission by conventional pathologic analysis. Assessing the association of MRD status following induction therapy in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with relapse and mortality may improve the efficiency of clinical trials and accelerate drug development. Objective To quantify the relationships between event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) with MRD status in pediatric and adult ALL using publications of clinical trials and other databases. Data Sources Clinical studies in ALL identified via searches of PubMed, MEDLINE, and clinicaltrials.gov. Study Selection Our search and study screening process adhered to the PRISMA Guidelines. Studies that addressed EFS or OS by MRD status in patients with ALL were included; reviews, abstracts, and studies with fewer than 30 patients or insufficient MRD description were excluded. Data Extraction and Synthesis Study sample size, patient age, follow-up time, timing of MRD assessment (postinduction or consolidation), MRD detection method, phenotype/genotype (B cell, T cell, Philadelphia chromosome), and EFS and OS. Searches of PubMed and MEDLINE identified 566 articles. A parallel search on clinicaltrials.gov found 67 closed trials and 62 open trials as of 2014. Merging results of 2 independent searches and applying exclusions gave 39 publications in 3 arms of patient populations (adult, pediatric, and mixed). We performed separate meta-analyses for each of these 3 subpopulations. Results The 39 publications comprised 13 637 patients: 16 adult studies (2076 patients), 20 pediatric (11 249 patients), and 3 mixed (312 patients). The EFS hazard ratio (HR) for achieving MRD negativity is 0.23 (95{\%} Bayesian credible interval [BCI] 0.18-0.28) for pediatric patients and 0.28 (95{\%} BCI, 0.24-0.33) for adults. The respective HRs in OS are 0.28 (95{\%} BCI, 0.19-0.41) and 0.28 (95{\%} BCI, 0.20-0.39). The effect was similar across all subgroups and covariates. Conclusions and Relevance The value of having achieved MRD negativity is substantial in both pediatric and adult patients with ALL. These results are consistent across therapies, methods of and times of MRD assessment, cutoff levels, and disease subtypes. Minimal residual disease status warrants consideration as an early measure of disease response for evaluating new therapies, improving the efficiency of clinical trials, accelerating drug development, and for regulatory approval. A caveat is that an accelerated approval of a particular new drug using an intermediate end point, such as MRD, would require confirmation using traditional efficacy end points.},

The term " clinical research " is meant to cover all types of investigation that address questions on the treatment, prevention, diagnosis/screening, or prognosis of disease or enhancement and maintenance of health. Experimental intervention studies (clinical trials) are the major design intended to answer such questions, but observa-tional studies may also offer relevant evidence.

There are many millions of papers of clinical research—approximately 1 million papers from clinical trials have been published to date, along with tens of thousands of systematic reviews—but most of them are not useful.

abstract = {Reviewers of research reports frequently criticize the choice of statistical methods. While some of these criticisms are well-founded, frequently the use of various parametric methods such as analysis of variance, regression, correlation are faulted because: (a) the sample size is too small, (b) the data may not be normally distributed, or (c) The data are from Likert scales, which are ordinal, so parametric statistics cannot be used. In this paper, I dissect these arguments, and show that many studies, dating back to the 1930s consistently show that parametric statistics are robust with respect to violations of these assumptions. Hence, challenges like those above are unfounded, and parametric methods can be utilized without concern for "getting the wrong answer".},

Ponatinib (AP24534) is a potent oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks native and mutated BCR-ABL, including the gatekeeper mutant T315I, which is uniformly resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: In this phase 1 dose-escalation study, we enrolled 81 patients with resistant hematologic cancers, including 60 with CML and 5 with Ph-positive ALL. Ponatinib was administered once daily at doses ranging from 2 to 60 mg. Median follow-up was 56 weeks (range, 2 to 140).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Dose-limiting toxic effects included elevated lipase or amylase levels and pancreatitis. Common adverse events were rash, myelosuppression, and constitutional symptoms. Among Ph-positive patients, 91{\%} had received two or more approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and 51{\%} had received all three approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Of 43 patients with chronic-phase CML, 98{\%} had a complete hematologic response, 72{\%} had a major cytogenetic response, and 44{\%} had a major molecular response. Of 12 patients who had chronic-phase CML with the T315I mutation, 100{\%} had a complete hematologic response and 92{\%} had a major cytogenetic response. Of 13 patients with chronic-phase CML without detectable mutations, 100{\%} had a complete hematologic response and 62{\%} had a major cytogenetic response. Responses among patients with chronic-phase CML were durable. Of 22 patients with accelerated-phase or blast-phase CML or Ph-positive ALL, 36{\%} had a major hematologic response and 32{\%} had a major cytogenetic response.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Ponatinib was highly active in heavily pretreated patients with Ph-positive leukemias with resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including patients with the BCR-ABL T315I mutation, other mutations, or no mutations.

abstract = {This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated anti–programmed cell death (PD)-1 immunotherapy (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) for overall efficacy, safety, and effective dose relative to standard chemotherapy or other conventional drugs in the treatment of malignant tumors. We searched the following databases, PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Wangfang Data, Weipu, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and the reference lists of the selected articles for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of anti–PD-1 therapies in humans. The outcome measures were overall survival, treatment response, and adverse events. Only four randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. Three of these evaluated responses to nivolumab, whereas one tested pembrolizumab. The result of our analysis suggested that nivolumab may improve the overall response rate in treating melanoma relative to chemotherapy and has few associated adverse events. Similarly, in metastatic melanoma patients, nivolumab had a significant advantage over dacarbazine in terms of 1-year survival, progression-free survival, and objective response rate. Regarding dose levels of nivolumab for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, the outcomes in response to 2 and 10 mg/kg were similar, but both had significant advantages over 0.3 mg/kg. In addition, pembrolizumab showed similar outcomes in response to 2- and 10-mg/kg treatment. Anti–PD-1 immunotherapy appears to be safe and effective for patients with melanoma or metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Our meta-analysis is limited, but additional clinical trials are warranted to verify this preliminary evidence of positive outcomes and before anti–PD-1 therapy can be recommended for routine clinical use.},

abstract = {Purpose The Freiburg Visual Acuity Test (FrACT) has been suggested as a promising test for quantifying the visual acuity (VA) of patients with very low vision, a condition often classified using the semi-quantitative clinical scale " counting fingers " (CF), " hand motion " (HM), " light perception " (LP) and " no light perception " . The present study was designed to assess FrACT perfor-mance in a sizable number of CF, HM, and LP patients in order to generate a setting for future clinical studies in the low vision range. Methods We examined a total of 41 patients (LP, n=11; CF, n=15; HM, n=15) with various eye diseases (e.g., diabetic retinopathy, ARMD), covering the clinical VA scale from LP to CF. The FrACT optotypes were presented at a distance of 50 cm on a 17-inch LCD monitor with four random orientations. After training, two FrACT measure-ments (test and retest) were taken, each comprising 30 trials. Results FrACT measures reproducibly the VA of CF and HM patients. In CF patients, FrACT resulted in a mean logMAR=1.98±0.24 (corresponding to a decimal VA of 0.010), for HM in a mean logMAR = 2.28 ± 0.15 (corresponding to a decimal VA of 0.0052). In all LP patients the FrACT values were close to what would be obtained by random guessing. The mean test–retest 95{\%} confidence interval was 0.21 logMAR for CF patients and 0.31 logMAR for HM respectively. Test-retest variability declined from 24 to 30 trials, showing that at least 30 trials are necessary. Conclusion FrACT can reproducibly quantify VA in the CF and HM range. We observed a floor effect for LP, and it was not quantifiable further. Quantitative VA measures are thus obtainable in the very low-vision range using FrACT.},

The risk of death was 41{\%} lower with nivolumab than with docetaxel (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95{\%} CI, 0.44 to 0.79; P{\textless}0.001). At 1 year, the overall survival rate was 42{\%} (95{\%} CI, 34 to 50) with nivolumab versus 24{\%} (95{\%} CI, 17 to 31) with docetaxel. The response rate was 20{\%} with nivolumab versus 9{\%} with docetaxel (P=0.008). The median progression-free survival was 3.5 months with nivolumab versus 2.8 months with docetaxel (hazard ratio for death or disease progression, 0.62; 95{\%} CI, 0.47 to 0.81; P{\textless}0.001). The expression of the PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) was neither prognostic nor predictive of benefit. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were reported in 7{\%} of the patients in the nivolumab group as compared with 55{\%} of those in the docetaxel group. Conclusions Among patients with advanced, previously treated squamous-cell NSCLC, overall survival, response rate, and progression-free survival were significantly better with nivolumab than with docetaxel, regardless of PD-L1 expression level.

abstract = {Abstract In dose-finding trials of chemotherapeutic agents, the goal of identifying the maximum tolerated dose is usually determined by considering information on toxicity only, with the assumption that the highest safe dose also provides the most promising outlook for efficacy. Trials of molecularly targeted agents challenge accepted dose-finding methods because minimal toxicity may arise over all doses under consideration and higher doses may not result in greater response. In this article, we propose a new early-phase method for trials investigating targeted agents. We provide simulation results illustrating the operating characteristics of our design.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, annual funding for biomedical research has more than doubled while new molecular entity approvals have declined by one third. OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of practices commonly employed in the conduct of large-scale clinical trials, and to identify areas where costs could be reduced without compromising scientific validity. METHODS: In the qualitative phase of the study, an expert panel recommended potential modifications of mega-trial designs and operations in order to maximize their value (cost versus scientific benefit tradeoff). In the quantitative phase, a mega-trial economic model was used to assess the financial implications of these recommendations. Our initial chronic disease trial design included 20,000 patients randomized at 1000 sites. Each site was assigned 24 monitoring visits and a {\$}10,000 per patient site payment. The case report form (CRF) was 60 pages long, and trial duration was assumed to be 48 months. RESULTS: The total costs of the initial trial design were {\$}421 million ({\$}US 2007). Following the expert panel's recommendations, we varied study duration, CRF length, number of sites, electronic data capture (EDC), and site management components to determine their individual and combined effects upon total trial costs. The use of EDC and modified site management practices were associated with significant reductions in total trial costs. When reductions in all five trial components were combined in a streamlined pharmaceutical industry design, a 59{\%} reduction in total trial costs resulted. When we assumed an even more streamlined trial design than has typically been considered for regulatory submissions in the past, there was a 90{\%} reduction in total trial costs. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that it is possible to reduce substantially the cost of large-scale clinical trials without compromising the scientific validity of their results. If implemented, our recommendations could free billions of dollars annually for additional clinical studies. Research in the setting of clinical trials should be conducted to refine these findings.},

abstract = {Traditional designs for phase I clinical trials require each patient (or small group of patients) to be completely followed before the next patient or group is assigned. In situations such as when evaluating late-onset effects of radiation or toxicities from chemopreventive agents, this may result in trials of impractically long duration. We propose a new method, called the time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM), that allows patients to be entered in a staggered fashion. It is an extension of the continual reassessment method (CRM; O'Quigley, Pepe, and Fisher, 1990, Biometrics 46, 33-48). We also note that this time-to-toxicity approach can be applied to extend other designs for studies of short-term toxicities. We prove that the recommended dose given by the TITE-CRM converges to the correct level under certain conditions. A simulation study shows our method's accuracy and safety are comparable with CRM's while the former takes a much shorter trial duration: a trial that would take up to 12 years to complete by the CRM could be reduced to 2-4 years by our method.},

In this study, 400 mg of nilotinib was administered twice daily to the patients with myeloid (MBP, n=105) or lymphoid blastic phase (LBP, n=31) CML. After a minimum follow-up of 24 months, major hematologic responses were observed in 60{\%} (MBP) and 59{\%} (LBP) of patients. Major cytogenetic responses (MCyR) were attained in 38{\%} (MBP) and 52{\%} (LBP) of patients; and complete cytogenetic responses in 30{\%} and 32{\%}, respectively. Median duration of MCyR was 10.8 (MBP) and 3.2 months (LBP). Median overall survival was 10.1 (MBP) and 7.9 (LBP) months with 12- and 24-month survival of 42{\%} (MBP 44{\%}, LBP 35{\%}) and 27{\%} (MBP 32{\%}, LBP 10{\%}), respectively. Twelve MBP patients and two LBP patients received subsequent stem cell transplantation. Myelosuppression was frequent, with grade 3/4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia in 68{\%}, 63{\%} and 47{\%} of patients, respectively. Grade 3/4 hypophosphatemia, hyperbilirubinemia and lipase elevation were observed in 15{\%}, 11{\%} and 11{\%} of patients, respectively. Nilotinib has significant efficacy in patients with BP CML, but given the limited long-term survival of these patients, novel agents are needed.},

Although several treatment options have been suggested, it is still a challenge in a clinical setting. This study is aimed at finding out an ideal analgesic, sedative and/or anxiolytic combination that would minimise the unwanted effects of ketamine. A total of 24 patients, with burns up to 20-50{\%} of total body surface area (TBSA), were included in the study and randomly divided into three groups. In group I, 2 mg kg-1 ketamine was administered. In group II, 1 mg kg-1 tramadol was administered and 30 min later, 1 $\mu$g kg-1 dexmedetomidine and 2 mg kg-1 ketamine was administered. In group III, 1 mg kg-1 tramadol was applied and 30 min later, 0.05 mg kg-1 midazolam and 2 mg kg-1 ketamine was administered. The evaluation was performed with cardiopulmonary monitoring, sedation and visual analogue pain scores and overall patient satisfaction. Any adverse effects of ketamine were recorded. The results showed that group II had better outcomes with respect to pain management during dressing changes. As a conclusion, the use of the combination of ketamine, tramadol and dexmedetomidine was found to be a good treatment option for the prevention of the procedural pain suffered by adult patients during dressing changes. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.},

abstract = {Decisions in statistical data analysis are often justified, criticized, or avoided by using concepts of objectivity and subjectivity. We argue that the words ‘objective' and ‘sub- jective' in statistics discourse are used in a mostly unhelpful way, and we propose to replace each of them with broader collections of attributes, with objectivity replaced by transparency, consensus, impartiality and correspondence to observable reality , and subjectivity replaced by awareness of multiple perspectives and context dependence. Together with stability , these make up a collection of virtues that we think is helpful in discussions of statistical foundations and practice. The advantage of these reformulations is that the replacement terms do not op- pose each other and that they give more specific guidance about what statistical science strives to achieve. Instead of debating over whether a given statistical method is subjective or objective (or normatively debating the relative merits of subjectivity and objectivity in statistical practice), we can recognize desirable attributes such as transparency and acknowledgement of multiple perspectives as complementary goals.We demonstrate the implications of our proposal with recent applied examples from pharmacology, election polling and socio-economic stratification. The aim of the paper is to push users and developers of statistical methods towards more ef- fective use of diverse sources of information and more open acknowledgement of assumptions and goals.},

SUMMARY This is a review of the general argument which says that the Bayesian formulation is necessary and sufficient to avoid certain logical inconsistencies. These inconsistencies relate both to the generation of recognizable subsets, examples of which are given in sections 2-4, and of mutually inconsistent confidence intervals. The argument that Bayesian probability assignments are necessary and sufficient to avoid such inconsistencies is sketched out in sec-tion 5 and given in full detail for finite sample and parameter spaces in section 6. A related formalization for estimation is reviewed in section 7. Section 8 considers in detail the problem of extending proofs from finite to infinite spaces, and section 9 considers likelihoods without priors. Section 10 reviews an application of Bayesian methods to a clinical trial now in progress, with special emphasis on the assignment of prior probabilities and the sensitivity of the analysis to such assignment.},

Methods This multicenter trial compared 1.0{\%} prednisolone sodium phosphate to placebo in the treatment of bacterial keratitis among 500 patients with culture-positive ulcers receiving 48 hours of moxifloxacin before randomization. The primary endpoint was 3 months from enrollment, and 399 patients were evaluated at 12 months. The outcomes examined were best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) and scar size at 12 months. Based on previous results, regression models with adjustments for baseline status and/or causative organism were used for analysis. Results No significant differences in clinical outcomes by treatment group were seen with the prespecified regression models (BSCVA: -0.04 logMAR, 95{\%} CI, -0.12 to 0.05, P =.39; scar size: 0.03 mm, 95{\%} CI, -0.12 to 0.18, P =.69). A regression model including a Nocardia-treatment arm interaction found corticosteroid use associated with a mean 1-line improvement in BSCVA at 12 months among patients with non-Nocardia ulcers (-0.10 logMAR, 95{\%} CI, -0.19 to -0.02, P =.02). No significant difference was observed in 12-month BSCVA for Nocardia ulcers (0.18 logMAR, 95{\%} CI, -0.04 to 0.41, P =.16). Corticosteroids were associated with larger mean scar size at 12 months among Nocardia ulcers (0.47 mm, 95{\%} CI, 0.06-0.88, P =.02) and no significant difference was identified by treatment for scar size for non-Nocardia ulcers (-0.06 mm, 95{\%} CI, -0.21 to 0.10, P =.46). Conclusions Adjunctive topical corticosteroid therapy may be associated with improved long-term clinical outcomes in bacterial corneal ulcers not caused by Nocardia species. ?? 2014 BY ELSEVIER INC.

abstract = {Background: Nilotinib has shown greater efficacy than imatinib in patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in chronic phase after a minimum follow-up of 12 months. We present data from the Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in clinical Trials-newly diagnosed patients (ENESTnd) study after a minimum follow-up of 24 months. Methods: ENESTnd was a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised study. Adult patients were eligible if they had been diagnosed with chronic phase, Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML within the previous 6 months. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive nilotinib 300 mg twice a day, nilotinib 400 mg twice a day, or imatinib 400 mg once a day, all administered orally, by use of a computer-generated randomisation schedule, using permuted blocks, and stratified according to Sokal score. Efficacy results are reported for the intention-to-treat population. The primary endpoint was major molecular response at 12 months, defined as BCR-ABL transcript levels on the International Scale (BCR-ABLIS) of 0??1{\%} or less by real-time quantitative PCR in peripheral blood. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00471497. Findings: 282 patients were randomly assigned to receive nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, 281 to receive nilotinib 400 mg twice daily, and 283 to receive imatinib. By 24 months, significantly more patients had a major molecular response with nilotinib than with imatinib (201 [71{\%}] with nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, 187 [67{\%}] with nilotinib 400 mg twice daily, and 124 [44{\%}] with imatinib; p{\textless}0??0001 for both comparisons). Significantly more patients in the nilotinib groups achieved a complete molecular response (defined as a reduction of BCR-ABLIS levels to ???0??0032{\%}) at any time than did those in the imatinib group (74 [26{\%}] with nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, 59 [21{\%}] with nilotinib 400 mg twice daily, and 29 [10{\%}] with imatinib; p{\textless}0??0001 for nilotinib 300 mg twice daily vs imatinib, p=0??0004 for nilotinib 400 mg twice daily vs imatinib). There were fewer progressions to accelerated or blast phase on treatment, including clonal evolution, in the nilotinib groups than in the imatinib group (two with nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, five with nilotinib 400 mg twice daily, and 17 with imatinib; p=0??0003 for nilotinib 300 mg twice daily vs imatinib, p=0??0089 for nilotinib 400 mg twice daily vs imatinib). At 24 months, survival was comparable in all treatment groups, but fewer CML-related deaths had occurred in both the nilotinib groups than in the imatinib group (five with nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, three with nilotinib 400 mg twice daily, and ten with imatinib). Overall, the only grade 3 or 4 non-haematological adverse events that occurred in at least 2??5{\%} of patients were headache (eight [3{\%}] with nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, four [1{\%}] with nilotinib 400 mg twice daily, and two [{\textless}1{\%}] with imatinib) and rash (two [{\textless}1{\%}], seven [3{\%}], and five [2{\%}], respectively). Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was more common with imatinib than with either dose of nilotinib (33 [12{\%}] with nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, 30 [11{\%}] with nilotinib 400 mg twice daily, and 59 [21{\%}] with imatinib). Serious adverse events were reported in eight additional patients in the second year of the study (four with nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, three with nilotinib 400 mg twice daily, and one with imatinib). Interpretation: Nilotinib continues to show better efficacy than imatinib for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase. These results support nilotinib as a first-line treatment option for patients with newly diagnosed disease. Funding: Novartis. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {1 The model Data collected in ecological studies are often complex. Studies may involve repeat observations on the same units (e.g., individuals, quadrats, stations). Predictor variables may be categorical or continuous, and interactions may be of interest. In addition, such data may contain excess zero-valued observations (with respect to a Poisson model) because of sampling variability and/or incom-plete knowledge of processes that generated the data (e.g., factors that define suitable species habitat) Zuur et al. (2009). Zero-inflated generalized linear mixed-effects models (ZIGLMMs) are a class of models, incorporating aspects of generalized linear models, mixed models, and zero-inflated models, that are both flexible and computationally efficient tools for data of this sort. The data for this example, taken from Zuur et al. (2009) and ultimately from Roulin and Bersier (2007), quantify the amount of sibling negotiation (vo-calizations when parents are absent) by owlets (owl chicks) in different nests as a function of food treatment (deprived or satiated), the sex of the parent, and arrival time of the parent at the nest. Since the same nests are observed repeatedly, it is natural to consider a mixed-effects model for these data, with the nest as a random effect. Because we are interested in explaining variability in the number of vocalizations per chick, the total brood size in each nest is used as an offset in the model. Since the same nests are measured repeatedly, Zuur et al. (2009) fitted a Poisson generalized linear mixed-effects model to these data (see their Section 13.2.2). We extend that example by considering zero-inflation. We use a zero-inflated Poisson model with a log link function for the count (Poisson) part [i.e., the inverse link is exponential] of the model and a logit link for the binary part [i.e., the inverse link is logistic] Y ij ∼ ZIPois($\lambda$ = exp($\eta$ ij), p = logistic(z i)) (1) where ZIPois represents the zero-inflated Poisson distribution, and logistic(z) ≡ (1+exp(−z)) −1 . The zero-inflated Poisson with parameters $\lambda$, p has probability p + (1 − p) exp(−$\lambda$) if Y = 0 and (1 − p)Pois(X, $\lambda$) if Y {\textgreater} 0.},

A statistical analysis of completed studies is provided and properties of a few types of parameter estimators are investigated analytically and using simulation. Themodel has been validated usingmany real completed trials. A statistical technique for predictive recruitment modelling for ongoing trials is developed. It allows the prediction of the remaining recruitment time together with confidence intervals using current enrolment information, and also provision of an adaptive adjustment of recruitment by calculating the number of additional centres required to accomplish a study up to a certain deadline with a pre-specified probability. Results are illustrated for different recruitment scenarios.},

A European LeukemiaNet expert panel reviewed prior and new studies to update recommendations made in 2009. We recommend as initial treatment imatinib, nilotinib, or dasatinib.

BCR-ABL1 transcript levels ≤10{\%} at 3 months, {\textless}1{\%} at 6 months, and ≤0.1{\%} from 12 months onward define optimal response, whereas {\textgreater}10{\%} at 6 months and {\textgreater}1{\%} from 12 months onward define failure, mandating a change in treatment. Similarly, partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) at 3 months and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) from 6 months onward define optimal response, whereas no CyR (Philadelphia chromosome-positive [Ph+] {\textgreater}95{\%}) at 3 months, less than PCyR at 6 months, and less than CCyR from 12 months onward define failure. Between optimal and failure, there is an intermediate warning zone requiring more frequent monitoring. Similar definitions are provided for response to second-line therapy. Specific recommendations are made for patients in the accelerated and blastic phases, and for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Optimal responders should continue therapy indefinitely, with careful surveillance, or they can be enrolled in controlled studies of treatment discontinuation once a deeper molecular response is achieved.},

abstract = {Objective: To estimate the smallest decrease in Headache Impact Test (HIT) scores that reflects meaningful clinical change among patients with chronic daily headache (CDH). Study Design and Setting: We applied four methods of estimating the minimum important difference (MID) to data from 71 patients with CDH who participated in a clinical trial. The HIT was administered at baseline and at the 6-week follow-up assessment. Patients were considered to have experienced meaningful improvement if they reported that their headache condition was "somewhat better" or "much better" at the 6-week follow-up. Results: Mean HIT scores at baseline and 6 weeks for all patients were 64.5 (standard deviation SD = 6.0) and 62.6 (SD = 5.7), respectively. HIT scores decreased 3.7 (SD = 4.4) and 1.4 (SD = 3.6) units, respectively, among patients who reported "somewhat better" change and those who reported no change at 6 weeks. Estimates of the MID of the HIT ranged from -2.7 to -2.3. Conclusions: The method that we judge to be most valid estimated the MID of the HIT at -2.3 units (95{\%} confidence interval = -4.3, -0.3). This suggests that a between-group difference in HIT change scores of 2.3 units over time among patients with CDH reflects improvement in patients' headache condition that may be considered clinically significant. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Open access publishing can offer solutions that benefit researchers and other information users, as well as institutions and funders, but commercial journal publishers have influenced open access policies and practices in ways that favor their economic interests over those of other stakeholders in knowledge creation and sharing. One way to free research from constraints on access is the diamond route of open access publishing, in which institutions and funders that produce new knowledge reclaim responsibility for publication via institutional journals or other open platforms. I argue that research journals (especially those published for profit) may no longer be fit for purpose, and hope that readers will consider whether the time has come to put responsibility for publishing back into the hands of researchers and their institutions. The potential advantages and challenges involved in a shift away from for-profit journals in favor of institutional open access publishing are explored.},

The active drug was idebenone 900 mg/day. The primary end-point was the best recovery in visual acuity. The main secondary end-point was the change in best visual acuity. Other secondary end-points were changes in visual acuity of the best eye at baseline and changes in visual acuity for both eyes in each patient. Colour-contrast sensitivity and retinal nerve fibre layer thickness were measured in subgroups. Idebenone was safe and well tolerated. The primary end-point did not reach statistical significance in the intention to treat population. However, post hoc interaction analysis showed a different response to idebenone in patients with discordant visual acuities at baseline; in these patients, all secondary end-points were significantly different between the idebenone and placebo groups. This first randomized controlled trial in the mitochondrial disorder, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, provides evidence that patients with discordant visual acuities are the most likely to benefit from idebenone treatment, which is safe and well tolerated.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This phase I trial was undertaken to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of the novel smoothened inhibitor sonidegib (LDE225), a potent inhibitor of hedgehog signaling, in patients with advanced solid tumors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Oral sonidegib was administered to 103 patients with advanced solid tumors, including medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma (BCC), at doses ranging from 100 to 3,000 mg daily and 250 to 750 mg twice daily, continuously, with a single-dose pharmacokinetics run-in period. Dose escalations were guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model. Safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and biomarkers in skin and tumor biopsies were assessed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The MTDs of sonidegib were 800 mg daily and 250 mg twice daily. The main DLT of reversible grade 3/4 elevated serum creatine kinase (18{\%} of patients) was observed at doses ≥ the MTD in an exposure-dependent manner. Common grade 1/2 adverse events included muscle spasm, myalgia, gastrointestinal toxicities, increased liver enzymes, fatigue, dysgeusia, and alopecia. Sonidegib exposure increased dose proportionally up to 400 mg daily, and displayed nonlinear pharmacokinetics at higher doses. Sonidegib exhibited exposure-dependent reduction in GLI1 mRNA expression. Tumor responses observed in patients with medulloblastoma and BCC were associated with evidence of hedgehog pathway activation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Sonidegib has an acceptable safety profile in patients with advanced solid tumors and exhibits antitumor activity in advanced BCC and relapsed medulloblastoma, both of which are strongly associated with activated hedgehog pathway, as determined by gene expression.},

abstract = {How should we approach trial design when we can get some, but not all, of the way to the numbers required for a randomised phase III trial? We present an ordered framework for designing randomised trials to address the problem when the ideal sample size is considered larger than the number of participants that can be recruited in a reasonable time frame. Staying with the frequentist approach that is well accepted and understood in large trials, we propose a framework that includes small alterations to the design parameters. These aim to increase the numbers achievable and also potentially reduce the sample size target. The first step should always be to attempt to extend collaborations, consider broadening eligibility criteria and increase the accrual time or follow-up time. The second set of ordered considerations are the choice of research arm, outcome measures, power and target effect. If the revised design is still not feasible, in the third step we propose moving from two-to one-sided significance tests, changing the type I error rate, using covariate information at the design stage, re-randomising patients and borrowing external information. We discuss the benefits of some of these possible changes and warn against others. We illustrate, with a worked example based on the Euramos-1 trial, the application of this framework in designing a trial that is feasible, while still providing a good evidence base to evaluate a research treatment. This framework would allow appropriate evaluation of treatments when large-scale phase III trials are not possible, but where the need for high-quality randomised data is as pressing as it is for common diseases.},

abstract = {PURPOSE To assess treatment efficacy using spectral-domain (SD) optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements of papilledema in the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT), which evaluated the effects of acetazolamide and weight management and of placebo and weight management in eyes with mild visual loss. DESIGN Randomized double-masked control clinical trial of acetazolamide plus weight management compared with placebo plus weight management in subjects with mild visual field loss and previously untreated idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). PARTICIPANTS Eighty-nine (43 acetazolamide treated, 46 placebo treated) of 165 subjects meeting IIHTT entry criteria. METHODS Subjects underwent perimetry, papilledema grading (Fris{\'{e}}n method), high- and low-contrast visual acuity, and SD OCT imaging at study entry and 3 and 6 months. Study eye results (worse perimetric mean deviation [PMD]) were used for most analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, total retinal thickness (TRT), optic nerve (ONH) volume, and retinal ganglion cell layer (RGCL) measurements derived using 3-dimensional segmentation. RESULTS Study entry OCT values were similar in both treatment groups. At 6 months, the acetazolamide group had greater reduction than the placebo group for RNFL thickness (175 $\mu$m vs. 89 $\mu$m; P = 0.001), TRT (220 $\mu$m vs. 113 $\mu$m; P = 0.001), and ONH volume (4.9 mm(3) vs. 2.1 mm(3); P = 0.001). The RNFL thickness (P = 0.01), TRT (P = 0.003), and ONH volume (P = 0.002) measurements also showed smaller increases in subjects who lost 6{\%} or more of study entry weight. The acetazolamide (3.6 $\mu$m) and placebo (2.1 $\mu$m) groups showed minor RGCL thinning (P = 0.06). The RNFL thickness, TRT, and ONH volume measurements showed moderate correlations (r = 0.48-0.59; P ≤ 0.0001) with Fris{\'{e}}n grade. The 14 eyes with RGCL thickness less than the fifth percentile of controls had worse PMD (P = 0.001) than study eyes with RGCL in the fifth percentile or more. CONCLUSIONS In IIH, acetazolamide and weight loss effectively improve RNFL thickness, TRT, and ONH volume swelling measurements resulting from papilledema. In contrast to the strong correlation at baseline, OCT measures at 6 months show only moderate correlations with papilledema grade.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE The ability of patients to measure their own intraocular pressure (IOP) would allow more frequent measurements and better appreciation of peak IOP and IOP fluctuation. OBJECTIVE To examine whether patients with glaucoma can perform self-tonometry using a rebound tonometer and examine patient acceptability. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS An observational study in which IOP was assessed using Goldmann applanation tonometry and a rebound tonometer. Consecutive patients were provided with a patient information sheet and those consenting to take part in the study received standardized self-tonometry training and were then instructed to measure their own IOP under observation. This study was conducted at a glaucoma clinic at a university hospital from March 1, 2016, to December 30, 2016, and included both eyes of 100 patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The percentage of patients who could successfully perform self-tonometry. Complete success was defined by a good technique and an IOP reading within 5 mm Hg of that obtained by a clinician using the same device. A 3-item questionnaire was used to examine perceptions of self-tonometry among patients. RESULTS Among the 100 patients, the mean (SD) age was 67.5 (10.9) years (53{\%} female). A total 73 of 100 patients (73{\%}) met the complete success criteria. An additional 6 patients could use the device but had IOP readings greater than 5 mm Hg different from those obtained by the clinician. On average, IOP by the rebound tonometer was 2.66 mm Hg lower than Goldmann applanation tonometry (95{\%} limits of agreement, −3.48 to 8.80 mm Hg). The IOPs with the rebound tonometer were similar whether obtained by self-tonometry or investigator, with excellent reproducibility with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.903 (95{\%} CI, 0.867-0.928). A total of 56 of 79 successful or partially successful patients (71{\%}) felt self-tonometry was easy, with 73 of 79 (92{\%}) reporting self-tonometry to be comfortable, and a similar number happy to perform self-tonometry in the future. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Most patients could perform self-tonometry and the method was acceptable to patients. Self-tonometry has the potential to improve patient engagement, while also providing a more complete picture of IOP changes over time.},

Unfortunately, many textbook treatments of the topic are written with neither illustrations nor intuition, and their victims can be found to this day babbling senselessly in the corners of dusty libraries. For this reason, a deep, geometric understanding of the method has been reserved for the elite brilliant few who have painstakingly decoded the mumblings of their forebears. Nevertheless, the Conjugate Gradient Method is a composite of simple, elegant ideas that almost anyone can understand. Of course, a reader as intelligent as yourself will learn them almost effortlessly. The idea of quadratic forms is introduced and used to derive the methods of Steepest Descent, Conjugate Directions, and Conjugate Gradients. Eigenvectors are explained and used to examine the convergence of the Jacobi Method, Steepest Descent, and Conjugate Gradients. Other topics include preconditioning and the nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Method. I have taken pains to make this article easy to read. Sixty-six illustrations are provided. Dense prose is avoided. Concepts are explained in several differentways. Most equations are coupled with an intuitive interpretation.},

Methods: Patients were randomised (2 : 1) to IMM-101 (10 mg ml {\`{A}} l intradermally) þ GEM (1000 mg m {\`{A}} 2 intravenously; n ¼ 75), or GEM alone (n ¼ 35). Safety was assessed on frequency and incidence of adverse events (AEs). Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) were collected. Results: IMM-101 was well tolerated with a similar rate of AE and serious adverse event reporting in both groups after allowance for exposure. Median OS in the intent-to-treat population was 6.7 months for IMM-101 þ GEM v 5.6 months for GEM; while not significant, the hazard ratio (HR) numerically favoured IMM-101 þ GEM (HR, 0.68 (95{\%} CI, 0.44–1.04, P ¼ 0.074). In a pre-defined metastatic subgroup (84{\%}), OS was significantly improved from 4.4 to 7.0 months in favour of IMM-101 þ GEM (HR, 0.54, 95{\%} CI 0.33–0.87, P ¼ 0.01). Conclusions: IMM-101 with GEM was as safe and well tolerated as GEM alone, and there was a suggestion of a beneficial effect on survival in patients with metastatic disease. This warrants further evaluation in an adequately powered confirmatory study.},

abstract = {Clinical trials have revolutionized medicine by providing reliable evidence on the efficacy and safety of new treatments. Until recently, clini-cal trials were designed and analyzed under the assumption that the effects of treatment were broadly similar in different individuals, and hence the goal of the clinical trial was primar-ily to provide precise and unbiased estimates of these common effects. Today, the advent of molecular biology has modified the funda mental tenet that the effect of treatment varies only ran-domly from patient to patient. There are indeed increasing numbers of treatments (especially targeted agents) whose effects vary widely as a function of individual molecular characteristics. When these characteristics are known early on in the course of developing of new treatments, clinical trials can be designed to target only those patients who are expected to benefit. However, more commonly, the exact molecular character-istics that drive a patient's response to a specific treatment are unknown and might only be dis-covered during the clinical development of the treatment or indeed following its approval. This fact has profound implications for clinical trials; it may indeed revolutionize the way in which tri-als are planned and executed [1–3]. The purposes of this article are, first, to discuss the ways in which biomarkers (including, but not limited to, molecular characteristics) are validated in clini-cal trials, and second, to consider how they can be incorporated into clinical trial designs with the goal of optimizing the use of new therapies in biomarker-defined subgroups of patients. Our examples all come from the field of oncology, where efforts to develop new methodologies for clinical research have been most intense, but fur-ther examples abound in the other therapeutic areas [4]. We will focus our discussion on statisti-cal issues, leaving aside practical considerations related to the bio markers themselves, such as their accessibility in specific tissues (e.g., in fresh, frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tis-sue) or the ease and reliability of their quantifica-tion (e.g., through reverse-transcriptase PCR or microarray), all of which greatly contribute to their potential for use in clinical practice.},

At median follow-up of 7{\textperiodcentered}2 months, median survival did not differ significantly between the groups in the overall population (5{\textperiodcentered}6 months for gefitinib and 5{\textperiodcentered}1 months for placebo; hazard ratio 0{\textperiodcentered}89 [95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}77-1{\textperiodcentered}02], p=0{\textperiodcentered}087) or among the 812 patients with adenocarcinoma (6{\textperiodcentered}3 months vs 5{\textperiodcentered}4 months; 0{\textperiodcentered}84 [0{\textperiodcentered}68-1{\textperiodcentered}03], p=0{\textperiodcentered}089). Preplanned subgroup analyses showed significantly longer survival in the gefitinib group than the placebo group for never-smokers (n=375; 0{\textperiodcentered}67 [0{\textperiodcentered}49-0{\textperiodcentered}92], p=0{\textperiodcentered}012; median survival 8{\textperiodcentered}9 vs 6{\textperiodcentered}1 months) and patients of Asian origin (n=342; 0{\textperiodcentered}66 [0{\textperiodcentered}48-0{\textperiodcentered}91], p=0{\textperiodcentered}01; median survival 9{\textperiodcentered}5 vs 5{\textperiodcentered}5 months). Gefitinib was well tolerated, as in previous studies. Interpretation: Treatment with gefitinib was not associated with significant improvement in survival in either coprimary population. There was pronounced heterogeneity in survival outcomes between groups of patients, with some evidence of benefit among never-smokers and patients of Asian origin.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE Establishing the natural history of G11778A Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is important to determine the optimal end points to assess the safety and efficacy of a planned gene therapy trial. OBJECTIVE To use the results of the present natural history study of patients with G11778A LHON to plan a gene therapy clinical trial that will use allotopic expression by delivering a normal nuclear-encoded ND4 gene into the nuclei of retinal ganglion cells via an adeno-associated virus vector injected into the vitreous. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective observational study initiated in 2008 was conducted in primary and referral institutional practice settings. Participants included 44 individuals with G11778A LHON, recruited between September 2008 and March 2012, who were evaluated every 6 months and returned for 1 or more follow-up visits (6-36 months) as of August 2012. EXPOSURES Complete neuro-ophthalmic examination and main measures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Visual acuity, automated visual field testing, pattern electroretinogram, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. RESULTS Clinical measures were stable during the follow-up period, and visual acuity was as good as or better than the other visual factors used for monitoring patients. Based on a criterion of 15 or more letters from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study chart, 13 eyes of 8 patients (18{\%}) improved, but 24 months after the onset of symptoms, any further improvements were to no better than 20/100. Acuity recovery occurred in some patients despite continued marked retinal nerve fiber layer thinning indistinguishable from that in patients who did not recover visual acuity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Spontaneous improvement of visual acuity in patients with G11778A LHON is not common and is partial and limited when it occurs, so improvements in vision with adeno-associated virus-mediated gene therapy of a synthetic wild-type ND4 subunit gene should be possible to detect with a reasonable sample size. Visual acuity appears to be the most suitable primary end point for the planned clinical trial.},

abstract = {There is a pressing need for more-efficient trial designs for biomarker-stratified clinical trials. We suggest a new approach to trial design that links novel treatment evaluation with the concurrent evaluation of a biomarker within a confirmatory phase II/III trial setting. We describe a new protocol using this approach in advanced colorectal cancer called FOCUS4. The protocol will ultimately answer three research questions for a number of treatments and biomarkers: (1) After a period of first-line chemotherapy, do targeted novel therapies provide signals of activity in different biomarker-defined populations? (2) If so, do these definitively improve outcomes? (3) Is evidence of activity restricted to the biomarker-defined groups? The protocol randomizes novel agents against placebo concurrently across a number of different biomarker-defined population-enriched cohorts: BRAF mutation; activated AKT pathway: PI3K mutation/absolute PTEN loss tumors; KRAS and NRAS mutations; and wild type at all the mentioned genes. Within each biomarker-defined population, the trial uses a multistaged approach with flexibility to adapt in response to planned interim analyses for lack of activity. FOCUS4 is the first test of a protocol that assigns all patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to one of a number of parallel population-enriched, biomarker-stratified randomized trials. Using this approach allows questions regarding efficacy and safety of multiple novel therapies to be answered in a relatively quick and efficient manner, while also allowing for the assessment of biomarkers to help target treatment.},

This study aimed to determine the MTD, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of linsitinib, a potent oral IGF1R/INSR inhibitor, with EGFR inhibitor erlotinib.Experimental Design: This open-label, dose-escalation study investigated linsitinib schedules S1: once daily intermittent (days 1–3 weekly); S2, once daily continuous; S3, twice-daily continuous; each with erlotinib 100–150 mg once daily; and a non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) expansion cohort.Results: Ninety-five patients were enrolled (S1, 44; S2, 24; S3, 12; expansion cohort, 15) and 91 treated. Seven experienced dose-limiting toxicities: QTc prolongation (3), abnormal liver function (2), hyperglycemia (1), and anorexia (1). Common adverse events included drug eruption (84{\%}), diarrhea (73{\%}), fatigue (68{\%}), nausea (58{\%}), vomiting (40{\%}). MTDs for linsitinib/erlotinib were 450/150 mg (S1), 400/100 mg (S2). On the basis of prior monotherapy data, S3 dosing at 150 mg twice daily/150 mg once daily was the recommended phase II dose for the expansion cohort. There was no evidence of drug–drug interaction. Pharmacodynamic data showed IGF-1 elevation and reduced IGF1R/INSR phosphorylation, suggesting pathway inhibition. Across schedules, 5/75 (7{\%}) evaluable patients experienced partial responses: spinal chordoma (268+ weeks), rectal cancer (36 weeks), three NSCLCs including 2 adenocarcinomas (16, 72 weeks), 1 squamous wild-type EGFR NSCLC (36 weeks). Disease control (CR+PR+SD) occurred in 38 of 75 (51{\%}), and 28 of 91 (31{\%}) patients were on study {\&}gt;12 weeks.Conclusions: The linsitinib/erlotinib combination was tolerable with preliminary evidence of activity, including durable responses in cases unlikely to respond to erlotinib monotherapy.

abstract = {Surgery and other invasive therapies are complex interventions, the assessment of which is challenged by factors that depend on operator, team, and setting, such as learning curves, quality variations, and perception of equipoise. We propose recommendations for the assessment of surgery based on a five-stage description of the surgical development process. We also encourage the widespread use of prospective databases and registries. Reports of new techniques should be registered as a professional duty, anonymously if necessary when outcomes are adverse. Case series studies should be replaced by prospective development studies for early technical modifications and by prospective research databases for later pre-trial evaluation. Protocols for these studies should be registered publicly. Statistical process control techniques can be useful in both early and late assessment. Randomised trials should be used whenever possible to investigate efficacy, but adequate pre-trial data are essential to allow power calculations, clarify the definition and indications of the intervention, and develop quality measures. Difficulties in doing randomised clinical trials should be addressed by measures to evaluate learning curves and alleviate equipoise problems. Alternative prospective designs, such as interrupted time series studies, should be used when randomised trials are not feasible. Established procedures should be monitored with prospective databases to analyse outcome variations and to identify late and rare events. Achievement of improved design, conduct, and reporting of surgical research will need concerted action by editors, funders of health care and research, regulatory bodies, and professional societies. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Iasonos2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: An extensive literature has covered the statistical properties of the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) and the modifications of this method. While there are some applications of CRM designs in recent Phase I trials, the standard method (SM) of escalating doses after three patients with an option for an additional three patients SM remains very popular, mainly due to its simplicity. From a practical perspective, clinicians are interested in designs that can estimate the MTD using fewer patients for a fixed number of doses, or can test more dose levels for a given sample size. PURPOSE: This article compares CRM-based methods with the SM in terms of the number of patients needed to reach the MTD, total sample size required, and trial duration. METHODS: The comparisons are performed under two alternative schemes: a fixed or a varying sample approach with the implementation of a stopping rule. The stopping rule halts the trial if the confidence interval around the MTD is within a pre-specified bound. Our simulations evaluated several CRM-based methods under different scenarios by varying the number of dose levels from five to eight and the location of the true MTD. RESULTS: CRM and SM are comparable in terms of how fast they reach the MTD and the total sample size required when testing a limited number of dose levels ({\textless}or=5), but as the number of dose levels increases, CRM reaches the MTD in fewer patients when used with a fixed sample of 20 patients. However, a sample size of 20-25 patients is not sufficient to achieve a narrow precision around the estimated toxicity rate at the MTD. LIMITATIONS: We focused on methods with practical design features that are of interest to clinicians. However, there are several alternative CRM-based designs that are not investigated in this manuscript, and hence our results are not generalizable to other designs. CONCLUSIONS: We show that CRM-based methods are an improvement over the SM in terms of accuracy and optimal dose allocation in almost all cases, except when the true dose is among the lower levels.},

This review aimed to describe recommendations for the design, delivery and reporting of randomised trials in surgical oncology. A literature search was carried out without date limits to identify articles related to trial methodology research in surgery and surgical oncology. A narrative review was framed around two open National Institute of Health Research portfolio trials in colon and rectal cancer: the STAR-TREC trial (ISRCTN14240288) and the ROCCS trial (ISRCTN46330337). Twelve specific challenges were highlighted: stand-ardisation of technique; pilot and feasibility studies; balancing treatments; the recruitment pathway; outcome measures; patient and public representation; trainee-led networks; randomisation; novel techniques and training; learning curves; blinding; follow-up. Evidence-based recommendations were made for the future design and conduct of surgical oncology trials. Better understanding of the challenges facing trials in the surgical treatment of cancer will accelerate high-quality evaluation and rapid adoption of innovation for the benefit of patient care.},

abstract = {An early phase clinical trial is the first step in evaluating the effects in humans of a potential new anti-disease agent or combination of agents. Usually called “phase I” or “phase I/II” trials, these experiments typically have the nominal scientific goal of determining an acceptable dose, most often based on adverse event probabilities. This arose from a tradition of phase I trials to evaluate cytotoxic agents for treating cancer, although some methods may be applied in other medical settings, such as treatment of stroke or immunological diseases. Most modern statistical designs for early phase trials include model-based, outcome-adaptive decision rules that choose doses for successive patient cohorts based on data from previous patients in the trial. Such designs have seen limited use in clinical practice, however, due to their complexity, the requirement of intensive, computer-based data monitoring, and the medical community's resistance to change. Still, many actual applications of model-based outcome-adaptive designs have been remarkably successful in terms of both patient benefit and scientific outcome. In this paper, I will review several Bayesian early phase trial designs that were tailored to accommodate specific complexities of the treatment regime and patient outcomes in particular clinical settings.},

Some concern the practical realities of clinical research on patients. Others are to do with the value and purpose of balance. Still others are to do with a confusion about the role of conditioning in valid statistical inference. I consider a simple game of chance involving two dice to illustrate some points about inference and then consider the seven misunderstandings in turn. I conclude that although one should not make a fetish of randomisation, when proposing alternatives to randomisation in clinical trials, one should be very careful to be precise about the exact nature of the alternative being considered if one is to avoid the danger of underestimating the advantages that randomisation can offer.

We tested the anti-PD-1 antibody lambrolizumab (previously known as MK-3475) in patients with advanced melanoma.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We administered lambrolizumab intravenously at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 or 3 weeks or 2 mg per kilogram every 3 weeks in patients with advanced melanoma, both those who had received prior treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab and those who had not. Tumor responses were assessed every 12 weeks.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 135 patients with advanced melanoma were treated. Common adverse events attributed to treatment were fatigue, rash, pruritus, and diarrhea; most of the adverse events were low grade. The confirmed response rate across all dose cohorts, evaluated by central radiologic review according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, was 38{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 25 to 44), with the highest confirmed response rate observed in the cohort that received 10 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks (52{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 38 to 66). The response rate did not differ significantly between patients who had received prior ipilimumab treatment and those who had not (confirmed response rate, 38{\%} [95{\%} CI, 23 to 55] and 37{\%} [95{\%} CI, 26 to 49], respectively). Responses were durable in the majority of patients (median follow-up, 11 months among patients who had a response); 81{\%} of the patients who had a response (42 of 52) were still receiving treatment at the time of analysis in March 2013. The overall median progression-free survival among the 135 patients was longer than 7 months.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced melanoma, including those who had had disease progression while they had been receiving ipilimumab, treatment with lambrolizumab resulted in a high rate of sustained tumor regression, with mainly grade 1 or 2 toxic effects.

abstract = {PURPOSE: Phase I clinical trials of new anticancer therapies determine suitable doses for further testing. Optimization of their design is vital in that they enroll cancer patients whose well-being is distinctly at risk. This study examines the effectiveness of knowledge transfer about more effective statistical designs to clinical practice. METHODS: We examined abstract records of cancer phase I trials from the Science Citation Index database between 1991 and 2006 and classified them into clinical (dose-finding trials) and statistical trials (methodologic studies of dose-escalation designs). We then mapped these two sets by tracking which trials adopted new statistical designs. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred thirty-five clinical and 90 statistical studies were identified. Only 1.6{\%} of the phase I cancer trials (20 of 1,235 trials) followed a design proposed in one of the statistical studies. These 20 clinical studies showed extensive lags between publication of the statistical paper and its translation into a clinical paper. These 20 clinical trials followed Bayesian adaptive designs. The remainder used variations of the standard up-and-down method. CONCLUSION: A consequence of using less effective designs is that more patients are treated with doses outside the therapeutic window. Simulation studies have shown that up-and-down designs treated only 35{\%} of patients at optimal dose levels versus 55{\%} for Bayesian adaptive designs. This implies needless loss of treatment efficacy and, possibly, lives. We suggest that regulatory agencies (eg, US Food and Drug Administration) should proactively encourage the adoption of statistical designs that would allow more patients to be treated at near-optimal doses while controlling for excessive toxicity.},

abstract = {'As ye randomise so shall ye analyse', is one way of describing Fisher's defence of randomization. Yet, when it comes to clinical trials we nearly always randomize but we rarely analyse the way we randomize and Fisher himself was no exception. Two controversies involving Fisher in the 1930s are discussed: one with Neyman concerning additivity and the other with Student concerning randomization. Their relevance today is considered, as is whether randomization inference in clinical trials is dead and whether modelling rules the day, whether minimization is an acceptable procedure and to what extent trialists confuse experiments with surveys. It will be maintained that a number of different possible purposes of clinical trials have been confused because in the case of the general linear model, under strong additivity, they can all be satisfied by a single analysis. More generally, however, this is not the case.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Immune checkpoint inhibition has been demonstrated to be an effective anticancer strategy. Several lines of evidence support the study of immunotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We assessed the safety and antitumor activity of the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor pembrolizumab in patients with advanced TNBC. METHODS KEYNOTE-012 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01848834) was a multicenter, nonrandomized phase Ib trial of single-agent pembrolizumab given intravenously at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks to patients with advanced PD-L1-positive (expression in stroma or ≥ 1{\%} of tumor cells by immunohistochemistry) TNBC, gastric cancer, urothelial cancer, and head and neck cancer. This report focuses on the TNBC cohort. RESULTS Among 111 patients with TNBC whose tumor samples were screened for PD-L1 expression, 58.6{\%} had PD-L1-positive tumors. Thirty-two women (median age, 50.5 years; range, 29 to 72 years) were enrolled and assessed for safety and antitumor activity. The median number of doses administered was five (range, 1 to 36 doses). Common toxicities were mild and similar to those observed in other tumor cohorts (eg, arthralgia, fatigue, myalgia, and nausea), and included five (15.6{\%}) patients with grade ≥ 3 toxicity and one treatment-related death. Among the 27 patients who were evaluable for antitumor activity, the overall response rate was 18.5{\%}, the median time to response was 17.9 weeks (range, 7.3 to 32.4 weeks), and the median duration of response was not yet reached (range, 15.0 to ≥ 47.3 weeks). CONCLUSION This phase Ib study describes preliminary evidence of clinical activity and a potentially acceptable safety profile of pembrolizumab given every 2 weeks to patients with heavily pretreated, advanced TNBC. A single-agent phase II study examining a 200-mg dose given once every 3 weeks (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02447003) is ongoing.},

Design Randomized, double-masked, 36-week, 3-period crossover clinical trial. Participants Fifty-six subjects with DME involving the center of the macula in one or both eyes. Methods Monthly intravitreous injections of bevacizumab (1.25 mg) or ranibizumab (0.3 mg). Main Outcome Measures Comparison of mean changes in visual acuity and central retinal thickness, tested using a linear mixed-effects model. Results Based on the linear mixed-effects model, the 3-month estimated mean improvement in visual acuity was 5.3 letters for bevacizumab and 6.6 letters for ranibizumab (difference, 1.3 letters; P = 0.039). Estimated change in optical coherence tomography (OCT) central subfield mean thickness (CSMT) was -89 ??m for bevacizumab and -137 ??m for ranibizumab (difference, 48 ??m; P {\textless} 0.001). Incorporating cumulative treatment benefit, the model yielded a predicted 36-week (9-month) average improvement in visual acuity of 7.1 letters (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 5.0-9.2) for bevacizumab and 8.4 letters (95{\%} CI, 6.3-10.5) for ranibizumab, and a change in OCT CSMT of -128 ??m (95{\%} CI, -155 to -100) for bevacizumab and -176 ??m (95{\%} CI, -202 to -149) for ranibizumab. There was no significant treatment-by-period interaction (i.e., treatment difference was constant in all 3 periods), nor was there a significant differential carryover effect from one period to the next. Conclusions This trial demonstrated a statistically significant but small relative clinical benefit of ranibizumab compared with bevacizumab for treatment of DME, using a markedly reduced sample size relative to a full comparative efficacy study. The effects on visual acuity and central retinal thickness for the 2 drugs are consistent with those reported at 1 year for the concurrent parallel-group trial by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network testing bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept for DME. The 3-period crossover design allowed for meaningful and efficient comparison, suggesting that this approach may be useful for future comparative efficacy studies of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drugs for DME.},

abstract = {Novel therapies are challenging the standards of drug development. Agents with specific biologic targets, unknown dose-efficacy curves, and limited toxicity mandate novel designs to identify biologically optimal doses. We review two model-based designs that utilize either a proportional odds model or a continuation ratio model to identify an optimal dose of a single or two-agent combination in a Phase I setting utilizing both toxicity and efficacy data. A continual reassessment method with straightforward dose selection criterion using accumulated data from all patients treated until that time point is employed while allowing for separate toxicity and efficacy curves for each drug in a two-drug setting. The simulation studies demonstrate considerable promise, at least theoretically, in the ability of such model-based designs to identify the optimal dose. Despite such favorable operating characteristics, there are several pragmatic challenges that hinder the routine implementation of such model-based designs in practice. We review and offer practical solutions to potentially overcome some of these challenges. The acceptance and integration of these designs in practice may be quicker and easier if they are developed in concert with a clinical paradigm.},

When covariate information on patients is available, logistic regression and other multivariate techniques are often used to select prognostic factors and create predictive models. An example shows how the explicit aim of prediction needs to be taken into account in such modelling, and how predictive performance may be assessed by decomposition of a scoring rule. Secondly, results from a program that provides pretrial and interim predictions in clinical trials are displayed, bringing together the use of subjective opinion, Bayesian methodology and techniques for evaluating and criticizing predictions.},

abstract = {Continuous variables (such as intraocular pressure (IOP), visual acuity, contrast sensitivity) are commonly measured in clinical ophthalmology and vision research. In clinical practice, a ‘status' (category) can sometimes be assigned to an individual patient using a cutpoint in the value of a continuous variable; for example, a diagnosis of glaucoma might be confirmed by an elevated IOP measurement (eg, IOP {\textgreater}21 mm Hg). Indeed much of medicine revolves around an implicit classification of individuals into diseased and non-diseased. In clinical research, continuous variables may likewise be converted to categorical variables, assigning individuals to one of two groups. Although this may be appropriate for some specific studies where the underlying distribution of the variable shows a clear grouping, such dichotomisation has several drawbacks.1 Dichotomisation may be driven by the research question, for example, a study to investigate the health service needs of those with low vision, in which dichotomisation uses WHO visual acuity threshold for low vision.2 It may sometimes be used to bring the data in line with the clinical classification of patients but often the reason for dichotomisation of data is that it is thought to simplify the statistical analysis (eg, to enable use of a t test or a $\chi$2 test) and the presentation and interpretation of data. However, this simplification has a cost in terms of loss of information3 and may compromise the validity of the statistical analysis. We will discuss the disadvantages of dichotomisation and outline some points to consider before categorising continuous data. It should be noted that while the focus here is on categorisation of data into two groups, the problems arising when dichotomising data are inherent with any categorisation of data (two or more groups). Dichotomisation results, first, in the loss of descriptive information on the study population. For example, the {\ldots}},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The programmed death (PD-1) inhibitor pembrolizumab has been recently approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma. We evaluated the clinical activity of pembrolizumab in melanoma patients treated under the Spanish Expanded Access Program. METHODS Advanced melanoma patients who failed to previous treatment lines were treated with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every three weeks. Patients with brain metastases were not excluded if they were asymptomatic. Data were retrospectively collected from 21 centers in the Spanish Melanoma Group. RESULTS Sixty-seven advanced melanoma patients were analyzed. Most patients were stage M1c (73.1{\%}), had high LDH levels (55.2{\%}) and had ECOG PS 1 or higher (59.7{\%}). For cutaneous melanoma patients, median overall survival was 14.0 months; the 18-month overall survival rate was 47.1{\%}. Overall response rate was 27{\%}, including three patients with complete responses (6.5{\%}). Median response duration was not reached, with 83.3{\%} of responses ongoing (3.5 m+ to 20.4 m+). From ten patients included with brain metastases, four (40{\%}) had an objective response, two (20{\%}) of them achieved a complete response. Significant prognostic factors for overall survival were LDH level, ECOG PS and objective response. There were no serious adverse events. CONCLUSION Although this was a heavily pretreated cohort, pembrolizumab activity at the approved dose and schedule was confirmed in the clinical setting with long-term responders, also including patients with brain metastases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab is the standard-of-care treatment for patients with advanced melanoma. Pembrolizumab inhibits the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint and has antitumor activity in patients with advanced melanoma. METHODS In this randomized, controlled, phase 3 study, we assigned 834 patients with advanced melanoma in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive pembrolizumab (at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight) every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks or four doses of ipilimumab (at 3 mg per kilogram) every 3 weeks. Primary end points were progression-free and overall survival. RESULTS The estimated 6-month progression-free-survival rates were 47.3{\%} for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks, 46.4{\%} for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, and 26.5{\%} for ipilimumab (hazard ratio for disease progression, 0.58; P{\textless}0.001 for both pembrolizumab regimens versus ipilimumab; 95{\%} confidence intervals [CIs], 0.46 to 0.72 and 0.47 to 0.72, respectively). Estimated 12-month survival rates were 74.1{\%}, 68.4{\%}, and 58.2{\%}, respectively (hazard ratio for death for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks, 0.63; 95{\%} CI, 0.47 to 0.83; P=0.0005; hazard ratio for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, 0.69; 95{\%} CI, 0.52 to 0.90; P=0.0036). The response rate was improved with pembrolizumab administered every 2 weeks (33.7{\%}) and every 3 weeks (32.9{\%}), as compared with ipilimumab (11.9{\%}) (P{\textless}0.001 for both comparisons). Responses were ongoing in 89.4{\%}, 96.7{\%}, and 87.9{\%} of patients, respectively, after a median follow-up of 7.9 months. Efficacy was similar in the two pembrolizumab groups. Rates of treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 to 5 severity were lower in the pembrolizumab groups (13.3{\%} and 10.1{\%}) than in the ipilimumab group (19.9{\%}). CONCLUSIONS The anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival and had less high-grade toxicity than did ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence-based surgery has been established as a cornerstone of good clinical practice, promising to improve the treatment of patients and the quality of surgical education. However, evidence-based surgery requires dedicated clinicians trained to perform methodologically sound clinical investigations. Statistical knowledge is therefore invaluable. Surgical studies often cannot be randomized. Propensity scores offer a powerful alternative to multivariable analysis in the assessment of observational, non-randomized surgical studies. Unfortunately, many surgeons are unaware of this important analytical approach that has gained increasing stature in medical research. Thus, propensity score analyses are not used often in surgical studies. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of propensity score analysis, allowing the surgeon to understand the role, advantages and limitations of propensity scores, boosting their development in surgical investigations.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The Collaborative Initial Glaucoma Treatment Study (CIGTS) is a randomized, controlled clinical trial designed to determine whether patients with newly diagnosed open-angle glaucoma (primary, pigmentary, or pseudoexfoliative) are better treated by initial treatment with medications or by immediate filtration surgery. DESIGN Randomized, controlled clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS A total of 607 patients with open-angle glaucoma were enrolled. INTERVENTION Patients randomized to initial medications (n=307) received a stepped regimen of medications to lower intraocular pressure. Those randomized to initial surgery (n=300) underwent trabeculectomy to lower intraocular pressure. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Progression in visual field loss constitutes the study's primary outcome variable. Secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life, visual acuity, and intraocular pressure. RESULTS Randomized assignment resulted in a balanced distribution between treatment groups for most demographic and clinical measures assessed at enrollment. More males than females were enrolled (55{\%} were males), and a substantial percentage (38.1 {\%}) of enrollees were blacks. Most enrollees (90.6{\%}) were diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma; the remainder had either pseudoexfoliative (4.8{\%}) or pigmentary (4.6{\%}) forms of open-angle glaucoma. CONCLUSIONS Follow-up of this well-characterized group of patients should provide well-rounded guidance, based on both traditional ophthalmic measures and patients' perspectives on their health-related quality of life, on how best to initially treat open-angle glaucoma.},

Given their arrival at the turn of the millennium, we might think that they are a recent invention. That is not the case. The earliest idea of an AD predates Bradford Hill's MRC tuberculosis study, appearing in Biometrika in 1933. In this paper, we trace the development of response-ADs, designs in which the allocation to intervention arms depends on the responses of subjects already treated. We describe some statistical details underlying the designs, but our main focus is to describe and comment on ADs from the medical research literature.

abstract = {A Bayesian adaptive design is proposed for dose-finding in phase I/II clinical trials to incorporate the bivariate outcomes, toxicity and efficacy, of a new treatment. Without specifying any parametric functional form for the drug dose-response curve, we jointly model the bivariate binary data to account for the correlation between toxicity and efficacy. After observing all the responses of each cohort of patients, the dosage for the next cohort is escalated, deescalated, or unchanged according to the proposed odds ratio criteria constructed from the posterior toxicity and efficacy probabilities. A novel class of prior distributions is proposed through logit transformations which implicitly imposes a monotonic constraint on dose toxicity probabilities and correlates the probabilities of the bivariate outcomes. We conduct simulation studies to evaluate the operating characteristics of the proposed method. Under various scenarios, the new Bayesian design based on the toxicity-efficacy odds ratio trade-offs exhibits good properties and treats most patients at the desirable dose levels. The method is illustrated with a real trial design for a breast medical oncology study.},

abstract = {Objective: This study used a larger sample size, added a long-term observation of the effect of intervention, and provided an integrated intervention of acupressure and interactive multimedia of visual health instruction for school children. The short- and long-term effects of the interventions were then evaluated by visual health knowledge, visual acuity, and refractive error. Design: A repeated pretest-posttest controlled trial was used with two experimental groups and one control group. Setting: Four elementary schools in northern Taiwan. Participants: 287 School children with visual impairment in fourth grade were recruited. Method: One experimental group received the integrative intervention of acupressure and interactive multimedia of visual health instruction (ACIMU), and another received auricular acupressure (AC) alone; whereas a control group received no intervention. Two 10-week interventions were separately given in the fall and spring semesters. The short- and long-term effects of the interventions were then evaluated by visual health knowledge, visual acuity, and refractive error. Results: During the school year the visual health knowledge was significantly higher in the ACIMU group than the control group (p{\textless}0.001). A significant difference in the changing visual acuity was in the three groups (p{\textless}0.001), with the improvement in the ACIMU group. No difference in the refractive error was found between any two groups (p{\textgreater}0.05). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that a long-term period of acupressure is required to improve school children's visual health. School children receiving the intervention of acupressure combined with interactive multimedia had better improvement of visual health and related knowledge than others. Further study is suggested in which visual health and preventative needs can be established for early childhood. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Proteins in the B cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family are key regulators of the apoptotic process. This family comprises proapoptotic and prosurvival proteins, and shifting the balance toward the latter is an established mechanism whereby cancer cells evade apoptosis. The therapeutic potential of directly inhibiting prosurvival proteins was unveiled with the development of navitoclax, a selective inhibitor of both BCL-2 and BCL-2-like 1 (BCL-X(L)), which has shown clinical efficacy in some BCL-2-dependent hematological cancers. However, concomitant on-target thrombocytopenia caused by BCL-X(L) inhibition limits the efficacy achievable with this agent. Here we report the re-engineering of navitoclax to create a highly potent, orally bioavailable and BCL-2-selective inhibitor, ABT-199. This compound inhibits the growth of BCL-2-dependent tumors in vivo and spares human platelets. A single dose of ABT-199 in three patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia resulted in tumor lysis within 24 h. These data indicate that selective pharmacological inhibition of BCL-2 shows promise for the treatment of BCL-2-dependent hematological cancers.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate daily function among individuals with Wolfram Syndrome (WFS) and examine whether any limitations are related to disease-related symptoms. METHODS: WFS (n = 31), Type 1 diabetic (T1DM; n = 25), and healthy control (HC; n = 29) participants completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Questionnaire (PEDSQL) Self and Parent Report. PEDSQL domain scores were compared among these groups and between WFS patients with and without specific disease-related symptoms. Relationships between PEDSQL scores and symptom severity as assessed by the Wolfram Unified Rating Scale (WURS) Physical Scale were also examined. RESULTS: Across most domains, the WFS group had lower PEDSQL Self and Parent Report scores than the T1DM and HC groups. WFS participants with urinary, sleep, and temperature regulation problems had lower PEDSQL scores than those without. The WURS Physical Scale correlated with Self and Parent Report PEDSQL domains. WFS group Self and Parent Reports correlated with each other. CONCLUSIONS: The WFS group reported lower daily function compared to T1DM and HC groups. Within WFS, worse symptom severity and the specific symptoms of sleep, temperature regulation, and urinary problems were associated with poorer daily function. These findings provide rationale for an increased emphasis on identifying, treating and understanding these less well-known symptoms of WFS.},

The optimal safe dose is the dose, from among the doses with toxicity rate less than the maximum tolerable level, that maximizes the probability of response and no toxicity. We present a new sequential design to maximize the number of subjects assigned in the neighborhood of the optimal safe dose in a dose-finding trial with two outcomes.},

abstract = {Background: Benefits of calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) inhibition have not been established in chronic migraine. Here we assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of two doses of TEV-48125, a monoclonal anti-CGRP antibody, in the preventive treatment of chronic migraine. Methods: In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 2b study, we enrolled men and women (aged 18-65 years) from 62 sites in the USA who had chronic migraine. Using a randomisation list generated by a central computerised system and an interactive web response system, we randomly assigned patients (1:1:1, stratified by sex and use of concomitant preventive drugs) to three 28-day treatment cycles of subcutaneous TEV-48125 675/225 mg (675 mg in the first treatment cycle and 225 mg in the second and third treatment cycles), TEV-48125 900 mg (900 mg in all three treatment cycles), or placebo. Investigators, patients, and the funder were blinded to treatment allocation. Daily headache information was captured using an electronic diary. Primary endpoints were change from baseline in the number of headache-hours during the third treatment cycle (weeks 9-12) and safety and tolerability during the study. Secondary endpoint was change in the number of moderate or severe headache-days in weeks 9-12 relative to baseline. Efficacy endpoints were analysed for the intention-to-treat population. Safety and tolerability were analysed using descriptive statistics. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number, NCT02021773. Findings: Between Jan 8, 2014, and Aug 27, 2014, we enrolled 264 participants: 89 were randomly assigned to receive placebo, 88 to receive 675/225 mg TEV-48125, and 87 to receive 900 mg TEV-48125. The mean change from baseline in number of headache-hours during weeks 9-12 was -59.84 h (SD 80.38) in the 675/225 mg group and -67.51 h (79.37) in the 900 mg group, compared with -37.10 h (79.44) in the placebo group. The least square mean difference in the reduction of headache-hours between the placebo and 675/225 mg dose groups was -22.74 h (95{\%} CI -44.28 to -1.21; p=0.0386), whereas the difference between placebo and 900 mg dose groups was -30.41 h (-51.88 to -8.95; p=0.0057). Adverse events were reported by 36 (40{\%}) patients in the placebo group, 47 (53{\%}) patients in the 675/225 mg dose group, and 41 (47{\%}) patients in the 900 mg dose group, whereas treatment-related adverse events were recorded in 15 (17{\%}) patients, 25 (29{\%}) patients, and 28 (32{\%}) patients, respectively. The most common adverse events were mild injection-site pain and pruritus. Four (1{\%}) patients had serious non-treatment-related adverse events (one patient in the placebo group, one patient in the 675/225 mg group, and two patients in the 900 mg group); no treatment-related adverse events were serious and there were no relevant changes in blood pressure or other vital signs. Interpretation: TEV-48125 given by subcutaneous injection every 28 days seems to be tolerable and effective, thus supporting the further development of TEV-48125 for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine in a phase 3 trial.

abstract = {Background: Essential strategies are needed to help reduce the number of post-operative complications and associated costs for breast cancer patients undergoing reconstructive breast surgery. Evidence suggests that local heat preconditioning could help improve the provision of this procedure by reducing skin necrosis. Before testing the effectiveness of heat preconditioning in a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT), we must first establish the best way to measure skin necrosis and estimate the event rate using this definition. Methods: PREHEAT is a single-blind randomised controlled feasibility trial comparing local heat preconditioning, using a hot water bottle, against standard care on skin necrosis among breast cancer patients undergoing reconstructive breast surgery. The primary objective of this study is to determine the best way to measure skin necrosis and to estimate the event rate using this definition in each trial arm. Secondary feasibility objectives include estimating recruitment and 30 day follow-up retention rates, levels of compliance with the heating protocol, length of stay in hospital and the rates of surgical versus conservative management of skin necrosis. The information from these objectives will inform the design of a larger definitive effectiveness and cost-effectiveness RCT. Discussion: This article describes the PREHEAT trial protocol and detailed statistical analysis plan, which includes the pre-specified criteria and process for establishing the best way to measure necrosis. This study will provide the evidence needed to establish the best way to measure skin necrosis, to use as the primary outcome in a future RCT to definitively test the effectiveness of local heat preconditioning. The pre-specified statistical analysis plan, developed prior to unblinded data extraction, sets out the analysis strategy and a comparative framework to support a committee evaluation of skin necrosis measurements. It will increase the transparency of the data analysis for the PREHEAT trial. Trial registration: ISRCTN ISRCTN15744669. Registered 25 February 2015},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The potential predictive role of programmed death-ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression on tumor cells in the context of solid tumor treated with checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1 pathway represents an issue for clinical research. METHODS: Overall response rate (ORR) was extracted from phase I-III trials investigating nivolumab, pembrolizumab and MPDL3280A for advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and genitourinary cancer, and cumulated by adopting a fixed and random-effect model with 95{\%} confidence interval (CI). Interaction test according to tumor PD-L1 was accomplished. A sensitivity analysis according to adopted drug, tumor type, PD-L1 cut-off and treatment line was performed. RESULTS: Twenty trials (1,475 patients) were identified. A significant interaction (p{\textless}0.0001) according to tumor PD-L1 expression was found in the overall sample with an ORR of 34.1{\%} (95{\%} CI 27.6-41.3{\%}) in the PD-L1 positive and 19.9{\%} (95{\%} CI 15.4-25.3{\%}) in the PD-L1 negative population. ORR was significantly higher in PD-L1 positive in comparison to PD-L1 negative patients for nivolumab and pembrolizumab, with an absolute difference of 16.4{\%} and 19.5{\%}, respectively. A significant difference in activity of 22.8{\%} and 8.7{\%} according to PD-L1 was found for melanoma and NSCLC, respectively, with no significant difference for genitourinary cancer. CONCLUSION: Overall, the three antibodies provide a significant differential effect in terms of activity according to PD-L1 expression on tumor cells. The predictive value of PD-L1 on tumor cells seems to be more robust for anti-PD-1 antibody (nivolumab and pembrolizumab), and in the context of advanced melanoma and NSCLC.},

This autocorrelational structure is likely to be a consequence of learn-ing, fatigue, or the ebb and flow of attention within an experiment (the 'human factor'). Unlike molecules or plots of barley, subjects in psycholinguistic experiments are intelligent beings that depend for their survival on constant adaptation to their environment, includ-ing the environment of an experiment. Three data sets illustrate that the human factor may interact with predictors of interest, both factorial and metric. We also show that, especially within the framework of the generalized additive model, in the nonlinear world, fitting maximally complex models that take every possible contingency into account is ill-advised as a modeling strategy. Alternative modeling strategies are discussed for both con-firmatory and exploratory data analysis.},

More specifically, we focus on trials where the effects are naturally dichotomized, that is, where the health of a patient has improved or not, and where a specific adverse effect has occurred or not. A case study provides an example of the way this model can help to solve some problems of suspected drug toxicity. Finally, the model is shown to be a part of a hierarchy of models and the way to select a best model is investigated.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Intravenous ibuprofen (IBU) has been found to be as effective as indomethacin for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants and has been associated with fewer adverse effects in comparative phase III studies. The dose regimen used (10-5-5 mg/kg/day) was based on limited pharmacokinetic data and no phase II study was available to determine the optimal dose of IBU for this indication. The present study was designed to determine the minimum effective dose regimen (MEDR) of IBU (one course) required to close ductus arteriosus in preterm infants. METHOD: A double-blind dose-finding study was conducted using the continual reassessment method, a Bayesian sequential design. Two distinct target closure rates were initially chosen according to postmenstrual age (PMA) at birth: 80{\%} in infants with a PMA of 27-29 weeks, and 50{\%} in infants with a PMA {\textless} 27 weeks. Forty neonates (20 in each PMA group) with PDA were treated between days 3 and 5 of life. Four different dose regimens were tested: loading doses of 5, 10, 15 or 20 mg/kg, followed by two doses (1/2 loading dose) at 24-h intervals. Efficacy was evaluated by echocardiography 24 h after the third infusion. RESULTS: In infants with a PMA of 27-29 weeks, the estimated MEDR was 10-5-5 mg/kg with a final estimated probability of success of 77{\%} (95{\%} credibility interval: 56-92{\%}). The 15-7.5-7.5 mg/kg dose regimen had a better estimated probability of success (88{\%}, 95{\%} credibility interval: 68-97{\%}), but resulted in more minor renal adverse effects. In contrast, in infants with a PMA {\textless} 27 weeks, the estimated MEDR was 20-10-10 mg/kg with an estimated probability of success of 54.8{\%} (95{\%} credibility interval: 22-84{\%}), whereas the conventional dose regimen resulted in a low estimated probability of success (30.6{\%}, 95{\%} credibility interval: 13-56{\%}). In these infants, compared with those with a PMA of 27-29 weeks, minor renal adverse effects were more frequent from the 10-5-5 mg/kg/day dose regimen and did not appear to be clearly dose related. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that the currently recommended dose regimen (10-5-5 mg/kg) of IBU is associated with a high closure rate (80{\%}) and few adverse effects in premature infants with a PMA of 27-29 weeks. The failure rate was much higher below 27 weeks. A higher dose regimen (20-10-10 mg/kg) might achieve a higher closure rate. However, tolerability and safety of this dose regimen should be assessed in a larger population before considering the use of these doses for ductus arteriosus closure.},

abstract = {Systematic reviews and meta-analyses usually synthesise evidence from studies reporting outcomes from particular interventions in specific diseases. For example, a meta-analysis of prophylactic antibiotics (intervention) in elective arterial reconstruction (disease) for rates of wound infection (outcome). However, because systematic reviews and meta-analyses are so widespread, a body of evidence often exists around specific intervention effects on particular outcomes over a range of diseases. So for example, a multitude of independent meta-analyses have evaluated rates of wound infection with and without the use of prophylactic antibiotics over multiple surgery types. A systematic review of systematic reviews is a means of synthesising evidence for the same intervention over multiple disease types. We propose a panoramic meta-analysis as a means of pooling effect estimates over systematic reviews of systematic reviews. We explore several methods ranging from a simple two-step approach, to a meta-regression or mixed effects approach, where variation between diseases are modelled as fixed covariate effects and between-study variation by random effects, and to a three-level hierarchical model in which exchangeability is assumed, which allows both a between-disease component of variance and a between-study (within disease) component of variance. In the surgery example, we pool 18 meta-analyses (each including between 4 and 26 studies) of prophylactic antibiotics reporting rates of wound infection from 18 different surgery sites to obtain a single pooled estimate of effect and estimates of between-disease, within-disease and within-study variability.},

Historical data are used to obtain an informative prior on covariate main effects, with uninformative priors assumed for all dose effect parameters. Elicited limits on the probabilities of efficacy and toxicity for each of a representative set of covariate vectors are used to construct bounding functions that determine the acceptability of each dose for each patient. Elicited outcome probability pairs that are equally desirable for a reference patient are used to define two different posterior criteria, either of which may be used to select an optimal covariate-specific dose for each patient. Because the dose selection criteria are covariate specific, different patients may receive different doses at the same point in the trial, and the set of eligible patients may change adaptively during the trial. The method is illustrated by a dose-finding trial in acute leukemia, including a simulation study.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the evidence across surgical specialties as to whether staples or sutures better improve patient and provider level outcomes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: A systematic review of systematic reviews and panoramic meta-analysis of pooled estimates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Eleven systematic reviews, including 13,661 observations, met the inclusion criteria. In orthopaedic surgery sutures were found to be preferable, and for appendicial stump sutures were protective against both surgical site infection and post surgical complications. However, staples were protective against leak in ilecolic anastomosis. For all other surgery types the evidence was inconclusive with wider confidence intervals including the possibly of preferential outcomes for surgical site infection or post surgical complication for either staples or sutures. Whilst reviews showed substantial variation in mean differences in operating time (I(2) 94{\%}) there was clear evidence of a reduction in average operating time across all surgery types. Few reviews reported on length of stay, but the three reviews that did (I(2) 0{\%}, including 950 observations) showed a non significant reduction in length of stay, but showed evidence of publication bias (P-value for Egger test 0.05).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Evidence across surgical specialties indicates that wound closure with staples reduces the mean operating time. Despite including several thousand observations, no clear evidence of superiority emerged for either staples or sutures with respect to surgical site infection, post surgical complications, or length of stay.},

This challenge has been recognized by all stakeholders who endorse the need for flexibility in the regulatory review process for novel therapeutics to treat rare diseases. In the United States, the best expression of this flexibility was the creation of the Accelerated Approval (AA) pathway.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-positive ALL) is frequently caused by mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain. Ponatinib (AP24534) is a potent oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks native and mutated BCR-ABL, including the gatekeeper mutant T315I, which is uniformly resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: In this phase 1 dose-escalation study, we enrolled 81 patients with resistant hematologic cancers, including 60 with CML and 5 with Ph-positive ALL. Ponatinib was administered once daily at doses ranging from 2 to 60 mg. Median follow-up was 56 weeks (range, 2 to 140).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Dose-limiting toxic effects included elevated lipase or amylase levels and pancreatitis. Common adverse events were rash, myelosuppression, and constitutional symptoms. Among Ph-positive patients, 91{\%} had received two or more approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and 51{\%} had received all three approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Of 43 patients with chronic-phase CML, 98{\%} had a complete hematologic response, 72{\%} had a major cytogenetic response, and 44{\%} had a major molecular response. Of 12 patients who had chronic-phase CML with the T315I mutation, 100{\%} had a complete hematologic response and 92{\%} had a major cytogenetic response. Of 13 patients with chronic-phase CML without detectable mutations, 100{\%} had a complete hematologic response and 62{\%} had a major cytogenetic response. Responses among patients with chronic-phase CML were durable. Of 22 patients with accelerated-phase or blast-phase CML or Ph-positive ALL, 36{\%} had a major hematologic response and 32{\%} had a major cytogenetic response.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Ponatinib was highly active in heavily pretreated patients with Ph-positive leukemias with resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including patients with the BCR-ABL T315I mutation, other mutations, or no mutations.

abstract = {One of the main concerns in multi-centre clinical trials is how to enrol an adequate number of patients during a specific period of time. Accordingly, the sponsors are keen to minimise the recruitment time for cost effectiveness purposes. This research tended to concentrate on forecasting the patients' accrual time for the pre-arranged number of sample size by simulating an on-going trial. The method was to model the data from the recruitment frequency domain and apply the estimations derived from the frequency domain to predict the time domain. Whereas previous papers did not concentrate on variations of recruiting over centres, this research assumed that patient arrivals followed the Poisson process and let the parameter of the process vary as a Gamma distribution. Consequently, the Poisson-gamma mixed distribution was confirmed as the promising model of the frequency domain. Then with the help of the relationship between the Poisson process and the exponential distribution, accrual time was predicted assuming that the waiting time between patients followed the Gamma-exponential distribution. As the result of the project, a trial was simulated based on the estimated values derived from completed trials. The first part of the prediction estimated the expected average number of patients per centre per month in an on-going trial. The second part, predicted the length of time (in months) to enrol specific number of patients in the simulated trial.},

This study evaluates the applicability on fine-needle aspirations (FNAs) of the novel Kiupel grading system, based on number of mitoses, multinucleated cells, bizarre nuclei and presence of karyomegaly. Fifty consecutive cases with pre-operative cytological diagnosis were included. In cytological specimens, approximately 1000 cells were evaluated, and the histological grade was assessed on the corresponding resected specimens. On cytology, the above parameters were significantly different between histologically low-grade and high-grade tumours (P {\textless} 0.001). The cytograding correctly predicted the histological grade in 47 cases (accuracy, 94{\%}; sensitivity, 84.6{\%}; specificity, 97.3{\%}). Two high-grade MCTs (4{\%}) were not detected on cytology. The cytograding can provide helpful insights to assist clinical decisions in most cases. However, the risk of underestimation in a minority of patients represents a limit to the overall utility of the technique.},

The designs can be carried out either in a single stage or can be conducted in two stages, with an interim analysis to assess whether the treatment appears sufficiently safe and effective to warrant continuing. The emphasis is on the derivation of stopping rules for phase II trials that require the enrollment of a small number of patients and are based on enumerating the exact distribution of the proposed test statistic. We illustrate the methods with a recent study that required the use of a group sequential design to monitor antitumor activity and toxicity.},

Ideally, these candidate biomarkers have been well studied in the phase II developmental stage, the performance characteristics of the classifier are well established in one or more retrospective validation, and the assay and predictive performance are reproducible and robust experimentally and analytically. However, completely phase II validated biomarkers for uses in phase III trial are often unavailable. Adaptive signature design (ASD) combines the biomarker identification and classifier development to the selection of candidate patients and a statistical test for treatment effect on the selected patient subgroup for phase III clinical trials. Biomarker-adaptive designs identify the most suitable target subpopulations, based on clinical observations or known biomarkers, and evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment on that subpopulation in a statistically valid manner. This review is concerned with statistical aspects in the biomarker adaptive design for randomized clinical trials. Statistical issues include the interaction test to identify predictive biomarkers, subgroup analysis, multiple testing and false discovery rate (FDR), classification of imbalanced class size data, sample size and power, and validation of the classification model.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.

abstract = {Buparlisib (BKM120) is an oral pan-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, targeting all four isoforms of class I PI3K ($\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\delta$). This open-label Phase I dose-escalation study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose of continuous daily buparlisib in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors. Secondary objectives included safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, antitumor activity and pharmacodynamic marker changes. Fifteen patients were treated at 25 mg/day (n = 3), 50 mg/day (n = 3) and 100 mg/day (n = 9) dose levels. One dose-limiting toxicity of Grade 4 abnormal liver function occurred at 100 mg/day. Considering the safety profile and the maximum tolerated dose in the first-in-man study of buparlisib in non-Japanese patients, further dose escalation was stopped and 100 mg/day was declared the recommended dose. The most common treatment-related adverse events were rash, abnormal hepatic function (including increased transaminase levels), increased blood insulin levels and increased eosinophil count. Hyperglycemia was experienced by two patients, one Grade 1 and one Grade 4, and mood alterations were experienced by three patients, two Grade 1 and one Grade 2. Pharmacokinetic results showed that buparlisib was rapidly absorbed in a dose-proportional manner. Best overall response was stable disease for six patients, including one unconfirmed partial response. In these Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors, buparlisib had a manageable safety profile, with similar pharmacokinetics to non-Japanese patients. The recommended dose of 100 mg/day will be used in future studies of buparlisib in Japanese patients.},

We quantify the mean bias and mean square error of the conventional estimates after selection depending on the number of treatments and the selection time during the trial. The cases without or with reshuffling the planned sample size of the dropped treatments to the selected ones are investigated. The mean bias shows very different patterns depending on the selection rule and the unknown parameter values. We stress the fact that the quantification of the bias is possible only in designs with planned adaptivity where the design allows reacting to new evidence, but the decision rules are laid down in advance. Finally, we calculate the mean bias which arises in a simple but influential regulatory selection rule, to register a new medical therapy only when two pivotal trials have both proven an effect by a statistical test.},

abstract = {The assessment of treatment effects from observational studies may be biased with patients not randomly allocated to the experimental or control group. One way to overcome this conceptual shortcoming in the design of such studies is the use of propensity scores to adjust for differences of the characteristics between patients treated with experimental and control interventions. The propensity score is defined as the probability that a patient received the experimental intervention conditional on pre-treatment characteristics at baseline. Here, we review how propensity scores are estimated and how they can help in adjusting the treatment effect for baseline imbalances. We further discuss how to evaluate adequate overlap of baseline characteristics between patient groups, provide guidelines for variable selection and model building in modelling the propensity score, and review different methods of propensity score adjustments. We conclude that propensity analyses may help in evaluating the comparability of patients in observational studies, and may account for more potential confounding factors than conventional covariate adjustment approaches. However, bias due to unmeasured confounding cannot be corrected for.},

The resulting 12-item short-form (SF-12) achieved multiple R squares of 0.911 and 0.918 in predictions of the SF-36 Physical Component Summary and SF-36 Mental Component Summary scores, respectively. Scoring algorithms from the general population used to score 12-item versions of the two components (Physical Components Summary and Mental Component Summary) achieved R squares of 0.905 with the SF-36 Physical Component Summary and 0.938 with SF-36 Mental Component Summary when cross-validated in the Medical Outcomes Study. Test-retest (2-week)correlations of 0.89 and 0.76 were observed for the 12-item Physical Component Summary and the 12-item Mental Component Summary, respectively, in the general US population (n=232). Twenty cross-sectional and longitudinal tests of empirical validity previously published for the 36-item short-form scales and summary measures were replicated for the 12-item Physical Component Summary and the 12-item Mental Component Summary, including comparisons between patient groups known to differ or to change in terms of the presence and seriousness of physical and mental conditions, acute symptoms, age and aging, self-reported 1-year changes in health, and recovery for depression. In 14 validity tests involving physical criteria, relative validity estimates for the 12-item Physical Component Summary ranged from 0.43 to 0.93 (median=0.67) in comparison with the best 36-item short-form scale. Relative validity estimates for the 12-item Mental Component Summary in 6 tests involving mental criteria ranged from 0.60 to 107 (median=0.97) in relation to the best 36-item short-form scale. Average scores for the 2 summary measures, and those for most scales in the 8-scale profile based on the 12-item short-form, closely mirrored those for the 36-item short-form, although standard errors were nearly always larger for the 12-item short-form.},

The assumptions underlying some of the conventional approaches to clinical trial design and analysis are no longer appropriate because of the molecular heterogeneity of tumors of a given primary site. This article reviews some clinical trial designs that have been actively applied in the codevelopment of therapeutics and predictive biomarkers to inform their use in oncology. These include the enrichment design, the basket design, and the umbrella design. Oncology leads most other therapeutic areas in development of personalized or precision medicine. Personalized or precision medicine is practiced daily in oncology on the basis of tumor genomics and may evolve in other therapeutic areas as it has in oncology, rather than according to inherited polymorphisms as so often imagined. Consequently, some of the clinical trial designs described here may serve as a possible blueprint for therapeutic development in fields other than oncology.},

Additionally, each has various possible adverse events making their tolerability less than optimal. Recently, three monoclonal antibodies targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) ligand (LY2951742, ALD403 and TEV-48125) and one targeting the CGRP receptor (AMG 334) have completed phase 2 trials, and the results have been reported. These early results show them all to be somewhat more effective than placebo, with no serious adverse events. Three have been studied for episodic migraine, and only TEV-48125 has been studied for both high frequency episodic and chronic migraine. Moreover, preliminary data suggests that neurostimulation is effective in migraine treatment, including stimulation of the sphenopalatine ganglion, transcutaneous supraorbital and supratrochlear nerve, and transcutaneous vagus nerve. In this article, these innovative therapies will be reviewed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Pain visual analogue scales (VAS) are commonly used in clinical trials and are often treated as an interval level scale without evidence that this is appropriate. This paper examines the internal construct validity and responsiveness of the pain VAS using Rasch analysis. METHODS: Patients (n = 221, mean age 67, 58{\%} female) with chronic stable joint pain (hip 40{\%} or knee 60{\%}) of mechanical origin waiting for joint replacement were included. Pain was scored on seven daily VASs. Rasch analysis was used to examine fit to the Rasch model. Responsiveness (Standardized Response Means, SRM) was examined on the raw ordinal data and the interval data generated from the Rasch analysis. RESULTS: Baseline pain VAS scores fitted the Rasch model, although 15 aberrant cases impacted on unidimensionality. There was some local dependency between items but this did not significantly affect the person estimates of pain. Daily pain (item difficulty) was stable, suggesting that single measures can be used. Overall, the SRMs derived from ordinal data overestimated the true responsiveness by 59{\%}. Changes over time at the lower and higher end of the scale were represented by large jumps in interval equivalent data points; in the middle of the scale the reverse was seen. CONCLUSIONS: The pain VAS is a valid tool for measuring pain at one point in time. However, the pain VAS does not behave linearly and SRMs vary along the trait of pain. Consequently, Minimum Clinically Important Differences using raw data, or change scores in general, are invalid as these will either under- or overestimate true change; raw pain VAS data should not be used as a primary outcome measure or to inform parametric-based Randomised Controlled Trial power calculations in research studies; and Rasch analysis should be used to convert ordinal data to interval data prior to data interpretation.},

The "lasso" minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly zero and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.

Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility was examined by means of intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and standard error of measurements (SEM). Results showed good ICC values and rather high SEM values for inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of elasticity measurements. For TEWL measurements, ICC values were good and SEM values were high for inter- and intra-observer reproducibility. There was a significant difference between the estimated mean elasticity values of normal skin and grafted scars and between normal skin and spontaneously healed scars (p ??? 0.003). For the estimated mean TEWL values, there was a significant difference between normal skin and spontaneously healed scars (p = 0.036). A significant negative relation was reported between mean TEWL and time after burn (p = 0.008). In clinical trials it is necessary to interpret patient-specific changes in elasticity and TEWL with caution, since the SEMs of both modes are rather high. We therefore recommend the use of a mean of repeated measurements of elasticity and TEWL to decrease the SEM. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.},

Here, we present data on the identification, in vitro and ex vivo pharmacology of a humanized Fab fragment designated as ACT017. ACT017 was selected out of 15 humanized variants based upon structural and functional properties. It was produced under GMP-like conditions followed by detailed physico-chemical analysis and functional characterization indicating high antigen-binding specificity and affinity. In addition, we demonstrate, in a dose-escalation study, that ACT017 has a high capacity to specifically inhibit collagen-induced platelet aggregation ex vivo after injection to the macaque without inducing thrombocytopenia, GPVI depletion or bleeding side effects as is the case for conventional anti-platelets. Therefore, ACT017 is a promising therapeutic candidate for the development of a new generation of safe and efficient anti-thrombotic drugs.},

abstract = {Objectives: We sought to determine whether the addition of spironolactone to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) improves left ventricular mass and arterial stiffness in early-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD). Background: Chronic kidney disease is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular disease and a high prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy and arterial stiffness that confer an adverse prognosis. It is believed that these abnormalities are in part a result of activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Methods: After an active run-in phase with spironolactone 25 mg once daily, 112 patients with stage 2 and 3 CKD with good blood pressure control (mean daytime ambulatory blood pressure {\textless}130/85 mm Hg) on established treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs were randomized to continue spironolactone or to receive a matching placebo. Left ventricular mass (cardiac magnetic resonance) and arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity/analysis, aortic distensibility) were measured before run in and after 40 weeks of treatment. Results: Compared with placebo, the use of spironolactone resulted in significant improvements in left ventricular mass (-14 ?? 13 g vs. +3 ?? 11 g, p {\textless} 0.01), pulse wave velocity (-0.8 ?? 1.0 m/s vs. -0.1 ?? 0.9 m/s, p {\textless} 0.01), augmentation index (-5.2 ?? 6.1{\%} vs. -1.4 ?? 5.9{\%}, p {\textless} 0.05), and aortic distensibility (0.69 ?? 0.86 ?? 10-3 mm Hg vs. 0.04 ?? 1.04 ?? 10-3 mm Hg, p {\textless} 0.01). Conclusions: The use of spironolactone reduces left ventricular mass and improves arterial stiffness in early-stage CKD. These effects suggest that aldosterone exerts adverse cardiovascular effects in CKD and that spironolactone is worthy of further study as a treatment that could reduce adverse cardiovascular events.

Given the availability of flexible software for analyzing longitudinal sequences of unequal length, implementation of likelihood-based MAR analyses is not limited by computational considerations. While such analyses are valid under the comparatively weak assumption of MAR, the possibility of data missing not at random (MNAR) is difficult to rule out. It is argued, however, that MNAR analyses are, themselves, surrounded with problems and therefore, rather than ignoring MNAR analyses altogether or blindly shifting to them, their optimal place is within sensitivity analysis. The concepts developed here are illustrated using data from three clinical trials, where it is shown that the analysis method may have an impact on the conclusions of the study.},

abstract = {We present a new adaptive Bayesian method for dose-finding in phase I clinical trials based on both response and toxicity. Although clinical responses are usually rare in phase I cancer trials, molecularly targeted therapy may make clinical responses more likely. In addition, biological responses may be common. Thus responses may be frequent enough to help decide how aggressive a phase I escalation should be. The model assumes that response and toxicity events happen depending on respective dose thresholds for the individual, assuming that the thresholds jointly follow a bivariate log-normal distribution or a mixture. The design utilizes prior information about the population threshold distribution as well as accumulated data. The next dose is assigned to maximize a patient-oriented expected utility integrated over the current posterior distribution. The design is evaluated through simulation with population parameters equaling estimates from early Gleevec trials. This exercise provides evidence for the value of the use of the proposed design for future clinical trials.},

abstract = {Traditional phase I studies find the therapeutic dose of an investigational drug based solely on toxicity and without regard to the drug's efficacy. We propose extending the continual reassessment method (CRM) to a bivariate trial design in which the maximum tolerated dose is based jointly on both toxicity and disease progression. We call our study design bCRM, for bivariate CRM, which we apply to a study of bone marrow patients seeking to find the optimal time after bone marrow transplant at which to taper immune suppression and eventually begin donor leukocyte infusions. We demonstrate through simulation that bCRM has excellent operating characteristics and compare the performance of bCRM in a bone marrow transplantation study to designs proposed by previous investigators. We also attempt to provide some direction to future investigators with regard to plausible models and distributions to use with a bivariate study design. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Methods: The formulae of sample size calculations for estimation of adequate sensitivity/specificity, likelihood ratio and AUC as an overall index of accuracy and also for testing in single modality and comparing two diagnostic tasks have been presented for desired confidence interval. Results: The required sample sizes were calculated and tabulated with different levels of accuracies and marginal errors with 95{\%} confidence level for estimating and for various effect sizes with 80{\%} power for purpose of testing as well. The results show how sample size is varied with accuracy index and effect size of interest. Conclusion: This would help the clinicians when designing diagnostic test studies that an adequate sample size is chosen based on statistical principles in order to guarantee the reliability of study. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Wason2015,
abstract = {Background The high failure rate in phase III oncology trials is partly because the signal obtained from phase II trials is often weak. Several papers have considered the appropriateness of various phase II end-points for individual trials, but there has not been a systematic comparison using simulated data to determine which end-point should be used in which situation. Methods In this paper we carry out simulation studies to compare the power of several Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) response-based end-points for one-arm and two-arm trials, together with progression-free survival (PFS) and testing the tumour-shrinkage directly for two-arm trials. We consider six scenarios: (1) short-term cytotoxic therapy; (2) continuous cytotoxic therapy; (3 + 4) cytostatic therapy; (5 + 6) delayed tumour-shrinkage effect (seen in some immunotherapies). We also consider measurement error in the assessment of tumour size. Results Measurement error affects the type-I error rate and power of single-arm trials, and the power of two-arm trials. Generally no single end-point performed well in all scenarios. Best observed response rate, PFS and directly testing the tumour-shrinkages performed best for a number of scenarios. PFS performed very poorly when the effect of the treatment was short-lived. In scenario 6, where the delay in effect was long, no end-point performed well. Conclusions A clinician setting up a phase II trial should consider the likely mechanism of action the drug will have and choose an end-point that provides high power for that scenario. Testing the difference in tumour-shrinkage is often powerful. Alternative end-points are required for therapies with a long delayed effect.},

abstract = {This is the first mental health strategy for Canada. Its release marks a significant mile- stone in the journey to bring mental health ‘out of the shadows' and to recognize, in both words and deeds, the truth of the saying that there can be no health without mental health. Although there are several population groups and policy areas for which the federal gov- ernment has important mental health responsibilities, the organization and delivery of health care, social services and education in Canada largely fall to provincial and territo- rial governments. Despite the fact that pan-Canadian initiatives could help all jurisdictions to improve mental health outcomes, planning documents that address these matters from the perspective of the country as a whole are rare. Jurisdictional challenges have been compounded by the stigma that has kept discussion of mental health issues out of the public arena for far too long. Changing Directions, Changing Lives is the culmination of many years of hard work and advocacy by people across the country. A key driver behind its development has been the testimony of thousands of people living with mental health problems and illnesses. In increasing numbers they have found the courage to speak publicly about their personal experiences and the many obstacles they face in obtaining the help and support they need from an underfunded and fragmented mental health system. Family members have echoed this assessment while pointing to the many challenges that they also confront. Service providers (within the mental health system as well as outside of it), researchers, and policy experts have added their voice to the chorus calling for much- needed change. They have all had a voice in the development of this Strategy.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE The programmed death 1 (PD-1) pathway limits immune responses to melanoma and can be blocked with the humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab. OBJECTIVE To characterize the association of pembrolizumab with tumor response and overall survival among patients with advanced melanoma. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS Open-label, multicohort, phase 1b clinical trials (enrollment, December 2011-September 2013). Median duration of follow-up was 21 months. The study was performed in academic medical centers in Australia, Canada, France, and the United States. Eligible patients were aged 18 years and older and had advanced or metastatic melanoma. Data were pooled from 655 enrolled patients (135 from a nonrandomized cohort [n = 87 ipilimumab naive; n = 48 ipilimumab treated] and 520 from randomized cohorts [n = 226 ipilimumab naive; n = 294 ipilimumab treated]). Cutoff dates were April 18, 2014, for safety analyses and October 18, 2014, for efficacy analyses. EXPOSURES Pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks, or 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks continued until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or investigator decision. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was confirmed objective response rate (best overall response of complete response or partial response) in patients with measurable disease at baseline per independent central review. Secondary end points included toxicity, duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. RESULTS Among the 655 patients (median [range] age, 61 [18-94] years; 405 [62{\%}] men), 581 had measurable disease at baseline. An objective response was reported in 194 of 581 patients (33{\%} [95{\%} CI, 30{\%}-37{\%}]) and in 60 of 133 treatment-naive patients (45{\%} [95{\%} CI, 36{\%} to 54{\%}]). Overall, 74{\%} (152/205) of responses were ongoing at the time of data cutoff; 44{\%} (90/205) of patients had response duration for at least 1 year and 79{\%} (162/205) had response duration for at least 6 months. Twelve-month progression-free survival rates were 35{\%} (95{\%} CI, 31{\%}-39{\%}) in the total population and 52{\%} (95{\%} CI, 43{\%}-60{\%}) among treatment-naive patients. Median overall survival in the total population was 23 months (95{\%} CI, 20-29) with a 12-month survival rate of 66{\%} (95{\%} CI, 62{\%}-69{\%}) and a 24-month survival rate of 49{\%} (95{\%} CI, 44{\%}-53{\%}). In treatment-naive patients, median overall survival was 31 months (95{\%} CI, 24 to not reached) with a 12-month survival rate of 73{\%} (95{\%} CI, 65{\%}-79{\%}) and a 24-month survival rate of 60{\%} (95{\%} CI, 51{\%}-68{\%}). Ninety-two of 655 patients (14{\%}) experienced at least 1 treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse event (AE) and 27 of 655 (4{\%}) patients discontinued treatment because of a treatment-related AE. Treatment-related serious AEs were reported in 59 patients (9{\%}). There were no drug-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with advanced melanoma, pembrolizumab administration was associated with an overall objective response rate of 33{\%}, 12-month progression-free survival rate of 35{\%}, and median overall survival of 23 months; grade 3 or 4 treatment-related AEs occurred in 14{\%}.

abstract = {The most abundant human steroids, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate ester DHEAS, may have a multitude of beneficial effects, but decline with age. DHEA possibly prevents immunosenescence, and as a neuroactive steroid it may influence processes of cognition and memory. Epidemiological studies revealed an inverse correlation between DHEAS levels and the incidence of cardiovascular disease in men, but not in women. To define a suitable dose for DHEA substitution in elderly men we studied pharmacokinetics and biotransformation of orally administered DHEA in 14 healthy male volunteers (mean age, 58.8 ¬± 5.1 yr; mean body mass index, 25.5 ¬± 1.5 kg/m2) with serum DHEAS concentrations below 4.1 {\OE}{\textordmasculine}mol/L (1500 ng/mL). Diurnal blood sampling was performed on 3 occasions in a single dose, randomized, cross-over design (oral administration of placebo, 50 mg DHEA, or 100 mg DHEA). The intake of 50 mg DHEA led to an increase in serum DHEAS to mean levels of young adult men, whereas 100 mg DHEA induced supraphysiological concentrations [placebo vs. 50 mg DHEA vs. 100 mg DHEA; area under the curve (AUC) 0‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}12 h (mean ¬± sd) for DHEA, 108 ¬± 22 vs. 252 ¬± 45 vs. 349 ¬± 72 nmol/L¬∑h; AUC 0‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}12 h for DHEAS, 33 ¬± 9 vs. 114 ¬±. 19 vs. 164¬± 36 {\OE}{\textordmasculine}mol/L¬∑h]. Serum testosterone and dihydrotestosterone remained unchanged after DHEA administration. In contrast, 17{\OE}≤-estradiol and estrone significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner to concentrations still within the upper normal range for men[ placebo vs. 50 mg DHEA vs. 100 mg DHEA; AUC 0‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}12 h for 17{\OE}≤-estradiol, 510 ¬± 198 vs. 635 ¬± 156 vs. 700 ¬± 209 pmol/L¬∑h (P {\textless} 0.0001); AUC 0‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}12 h for estrone, 1443 ¬± 269 vs. 2537 ¬± 434 vs. 3254 ¬± 671 pmol/L¬∑h (P{\textless} 0.0001)]. In conclusion, 50 mg DHEA seems to be a suitable substitution dose in elderly men, as it leads to serum DHEAS concentrations usually measured in young healthy adults. The DHEA-induced increase in circulating estrogens may contribute to beneficial effects of DHEA in men.},

@article{Lilford2001,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: (1) Methodological research has few well-defined tools and processes analogous to those available for reviews and data collection in substantive health technology assessment. (2) This project was set up to obtain researchers' and others' views on the innovative projects on research methodology under the NHS Health Technology Assessment Programme and the usefulness of the research. (3) The study was intended to span both epistemological and management issues. (4) The following issues were explored: (a) the degree to which researchers would feel constrained by the "Cochrane" approach to systematic reviews when undertaking reviews of a methodological nature; (b) whether methodological projects may require exceptional design and management arrangements, in view of their novelty, subjectivity and complexity; (c) whether researchers would seek out other methods, in addition to undertaking reviews of argument, as a means of extending their understanding of methodological issues (there may be three categories of research methods in methodology: reviews of methodological argument, studies that use the literature as a source of data, and research that collects new primary data); (d) whether the Methodology Programme overall can be considered a "success". METHODS: (1) Telephone interviews were carried out on researchers (one senior and one junior per project), resulting in 35 interviews from 19 of the 20 target projects. (2) A qualitative postal survey was sent to 12 people who had played a key role in the development of the Methodology Programme; replies were received from six of them. (3) Analysis was undertaken of the hit rates for 29 projects on the NCCHTA website by the end of February and the end of May 1999, comparing those concerned with methodology (n = 10) and those concerned with other issues (n = 19). RESULTS--UNDERTAKING METHODOLOGICAL RESEARCH: VIEWS OF RESEARCHERS: This section summarises the views of 35 researchers who were interviewed by telephone. RESULTS--UNDERTAKING METHODOLOGICAL RESEARCH: VIEWS OF RESEARCHERS: (THE NATURE OF METHODOLOGICAL REVIEWS): (1) There was a reluctance among researchers to use the term "systematic review" in the methodological context. (2) Practical problems in undertaking methodological reviews were found at every stage of the research process. (a) In the initial search stage, preplanned strategies were difficult to maintain, owing to the need to respond to the problems of too few or too many references. (b) At the analysis stage, most studies were not formally weighted, but there was implicit weighting in researchers' views of their merits or relevance. (c) It was often only at the synthesis stage that researchers could see clearly what their study was able to do; iteration was frequently necessary at this point. (d) It was difficult to form simple conclusions and recommendations beyond summaries of what was known in the field. (e) Dissemination activities were most often directed to other health service researchers, with some attention to NHS policy makers and research commissioners. RESULTS--UNDERTAKING METHODOLOGICAL RESEARCH: VIEWS OF RESEARCHERS (THE NEED FOR FLEXIBILITY): (1) Few researchers had amended their topic or methods once their research was under way, although some had made minor changes to their original plan, generally to refine the topic to fit the time or data available. (2) Changing a topic was seen as inappropriate unless checked with funders, but changes in research methods were viewed as reasonable because questions might be refined in the light of information gained or early thinking. RESULTS--UNDERTAKING METHODOLOGICAL RESEARCH: VIEWS OF RESEARCHERS (THE QUESTION OF BIAS): (1) Few researchers considered that this kind of research could be undertaken or presented in a wholly unbiased way because of the need to assess the research studied. (2) Objectivity was nonetheless seen as something that researchers should strive towards. Efforts to do so included presenting data clearly, separating findings from discussion, covering all points of view, setting out their own assumptions and values, and testing their ideas on others known to have differing views. (3) The formal peer-review process was not seen to have made a difference here, primarily because of the stage at which referees become involved. RESULTS--UNDERTAKING METHODOLOGICAL RESEARCH: VIEWS OF RESEARCHERS (PROJECT MANAGEMENT--TIMING AND TIME MANAGEMENT): (1) A majority of projects were completed within 3 months of their due date. Those studies completed roughly on time were considered to have efficient junior researchers and good project management, including clear deadlines for different stages of the research. (2) Some studies had severe problems of time management. Too much time tended to be spent on collecting and reading the literature and the writing stage was not always well planned. Referees' comments were also slow in coming. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},

abstract = {Objective. —To determine if inadequate approaches to randomized controlled trial design and execution are associated with evidence of bias in estimating treatment effects. Design. —An observational study in which we assessed the methodological quality of 250 controlled trials from 33 meta-analyses and then analyzed, using multiple logistic regression models, the associations between those assessments and estimated treatment effects. Data Sources. —Meta-analyses from the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Database. Main Outcome Measures. —The associations between estimates of treatment effects and inadequate allocation concealment, exclusions after randomization, and lack of double-blinding. Results. —Compared with trials in which authors reported adequately concealed treatment allocation, trials in which concealment was either inadequate or unclear (did not report or incompletely reported a concealment approach) yielded larger estimates of treatment effects (P{\textless}.001). Odds ratios were exaggerated by 41{\%} for inadequately concealed trials and by 30{\%} for unclearly concealed trials (adjusted for other aspects of quality). Trials in which participants had been excluded after randomization did not yield larger estimates of effects, but that lack of association may be due to incomplete reporting. Trials that were not double-blind also yielded larger estimates of effects (P=.01), with odds ratios being exaggerated by 17{\%}. Conclusions. —This study provides empirical evidence that inadequate methodological approaches in controlled trials, particularly those representing poor allocation concealment, are associated with bias. Readers of trial reports should be wary of these pitfalls, and investigators must improve their design, execution, and reporting of trials.},

abstract = {Analysis of subgroup results in a clinical trial is surprisingly unreliable, even in a large trial. This is the result of a combination of reduced statistical power, increased variance and the play of chance. Reliance on such analyses is likely to be more erroneous, and hence harmful, than application of the overall proportional (or relative) result in the whole trial to the estimate of absolute risk in that subgroup. Plausible explanations can usually be found for effects that are, in reality, simply due to the play of chance. When clinicians believe such subgroup analyses, there is a real danger of harm to the individual patient.

abstract = {Purpose The pan-Class I PI3K inhibitor buparlisib (BKM120) has shown activity in a range of preclinical cancer models. This first-in-man study was initiated to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of buparlisib (100 mg/day) and to assess safety and preliminary efficacy. Methods Patients with advanced solid tumors (N = 83) enrolled in a Phase I dose-escalation and -expansion study of single-agent buparlisib. Patients in the dose-expansion arm (n = 43) had tumor samples with PIK3CA and/or PTEN alterations. Results The most common cancers were colorectal (n = 31) and breast cancer (n = 21). Median number of prior antineoplastic regimens was four (range: 1–12). Grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) included asthenia (12.0 {\%}) and performance status decrease (9.6 {\%}). Treatment-related AEs (all grades) included decreased appetite, diarrhea, nausea (each in 33 {\%} of patients), hyperglycemia (31 {\%}) and rash (29 {\%}). One confirmed partial response (PR; triple-negative breast cancer) and three unconfirmed PRs (parotid gland carcinoma, epithelioid hemangiothelioma, ER + breast cancer) were reported. Tumor molecular status did not predict clinical benefit in the full study cohort, or among the colorectal or breast cancer subpopulations. Pharmacodynamic biomarkers (18F-FDG-PET, C-peptide, pS6) demonstrated dose-dependent changes; however, tumor heterogeneity precluded a clear correlation with clinical benefit. Conclusion Buparlisib was well tolerated up to the 100 mg/day dose and showed preliminary activity in patients with advanced cancers. Future studies in more homogeneous patient populations will evaluate buparlisib in combination with other agents and further investigate the use of predictive biomarkers.},

PATIENTS AND METHODSIn a multicenter phase III randomized trial, patients with advanced NSCLC, ECOG PS of 2, any histology at first and later amended to nonsquamous only, no prior chemotherapy, and adequate organ function were randomly assigned to P alone (500 mg/m(2)) or CP (area under the curve of 5 and 500 mg/m(2), respectively) administered every 3 weeks for a total of four cycles. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).ResultsA total of 205 eligible patients were enrolled from eight centers in Brazil and one in the United States from April 2008 to July 2011. The response rates were 10.3{\%} for P and 23.8{\%} for CP (P = .032). In the intent-to-treat population, the median PFS was 2.8 months for P and 5.8 months for CP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95{\%} CI, 0.35 to 0.63; P {\textless} .001), and the median OS was 5.3 months for P and 9.3 months for CP (HR, 0.62; 95{\%} CI, 0.46 to 0.83; P = .001). One-year survival rates were 21.9{\%} and 40.1{\%}, respectively. Similar results were seen when patients with squamous disease were excluded from the analysis. Anemia (grade 3, 3.9{\%}; grade 4, 11.7{\%}) and neutropenia (grade 3, 1{\%}; grade 4, 6.8{\%}) were more frequent with CP. There were four treatment-related deaths in the CP arm. CONCLUSIONCombination chemotherapy with CP significantly improves survival in patients with advanced NSCLC and ECOG PS of 2.},

The development and use of a 'core information set' as baseline information before surgery may improve understanding. A core set is a minimum set of information to use in all consultations before a specific procedure. This study developed a core information set for oesophageal cancer surgery.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Information was identified from the literature, observations of clinical consultations and patient interviews. This was integrated to create a questionnaire survey. Stakeholders (patients and professionals) were surveyed twice to assess views on importance of information from 'not essential' to 'absolutely essential' using Delphi methods. Items not meeting predefined criteria were discarded after each survey and the final retained items were voted on, in separate patient and professional stakeholder meetings, to agree the core set.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Some 67 information items were identified initially from multiple sources. Survey response rates were 76{\textperiodcentered}5 per cent (185 of 242) and 54{\textperiodcentered}8 per cent (126 of 230) for patients and professionals respectively (first round), and over 83 per cent in both groups thereafter. Health professionals rated short-term clinical outcomes most highly (technical complications), whereas patients prioritized information related to long-term benefits. The consensus meetings agreed the final set, which consisted of: in-hospital milestones to recovery, rates of open-and-close surgery, in-hospital mortality, major complications (reoperation), milestones in recovery after discharge, longer-term eating and drinking and overall quality of life, and chances of survival.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This study has established a core information set for surgery for oesophageal cancer.},

In a recent survey of the statistical content of papers in the BritishJournal ofOphthal-mology' it was evident that most papers used only relatively simple statistical techniques such as the XI test or t test; that data are frequently collected on pairs of eyes; and that few people know how to analyse such data in ways which are both valid and efficient. The problems ofcorrectly analysing correlated data are not trivial and this whole area is currently the subject ofextensive theoretical research. It is thus not surprising that there is a lag between methods becoming available and their widespread use. A recent review published in the Archives of Ophthal-mology' has described many of the latest developments. However, without a knowledge of statistical theory it is not easy to put such information to practical use. In this paper we consider one simple technique, the XI test, and show how easy},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Localised infections, and burn wound sepsis are key concerns in the treatment of burns patients, and prevention of colonisation largely relies on biocides. Acetic acid has been shown to have good antibacterial activity against various planktonic organisms, however data is limited on efficacy, and few studies have been performed on biofilms. OBJECTIVES We sought to investigate the antibacterial activity of acetic acid against important burn wound colonising organisms growing planktonically and as biofilms. METHODS Laboratory experiments were performed to test the ability of acetic acid to inhibit growth of pathogens, inhibit the formation of biofilms, and eradicate pre-formed biofilms. RESULTS Twenty-nine isolates of common wound-infecting pathogens were tested. Acetic acid was antibacterial against planktonic growth, with an minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.16-0.31{\%} for all isolates, and was also able to prevent formation of biofilms (at 0.31{\%}). Eradication of mature biofilms was observed for all isolates after three hours of exposure. CONCLUSIONS This study provides evidence that acetic acid can inhibit growth of key burn wound pathogens when used at very dilute concentrations. Owing to current concerns of the reducing efficacy of systemic antibiotics, this novel biocide application offers great promise as a cheap and effective measure to treat infections in burns patients.},

While therapies for ALS remain limited, basic and translational ALS research has been host to numerous influential discoveries in recent years.

Until recently, ALS clinical trials have relied on a limited cadre of 'traditional' outcome measures, including survival and measures of function. These measures have proven useful, although imperfect, in Phase III ALS trials. However, their utility in early-phase ALS trials is limited. For these early trials, outcome measures focused on target engagement or biological pathway analysis might improve trial outcomes and better support the drug development process.},

The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical activity of the PI3K inhibitor buparlisib (BKM120) in patients with HER2(+) advanced/metastatic breast cancer resistant to trastuzumab-based therapy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In the dose-escalation portion of this phase I/II study, patients with trastuzumab-resistant locally advanced or metastatic HER2(+) breast cancer were treated with daily oral doses of buparlisib and weekly intravenous trastuzumab (2 mg/kg). Dose escalation was guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of 18 enrolled patients, 17 received buparlisib. One dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3 general weakness was reported at the 100-mg/day dose level (the single-agent maximum tolerated dose) and this dose level was declared the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of buparlisib in combination with trastuzumab. Common ({\textgreater}25{\%}) adverse events included rash (39{\%}), hyperglycemia (33{\%}), and diarrhea (28{\%}). The pharmacokinetic profile of buparlisib was not affected by its combination with trastuzumab. At the RP2D, there were two (17{\%}) partial responses, 7 (58{\%}) patients had stable disease (≥6 weeks), and the disease control rate was 75{\%}. Pharmacodynamic studies showed inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/MEK/ERK pathways.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In this patient population, the combination of buparlisib and trastuzumab was well tolerated, and preliminary signs of clinical activity were observed. The phase II portion of this study will further explore the safety and efficacy of this combination at the RP2D. Clin Cancer Res; 20(7); 1935-45. {\textcopyright}2014 AACR.},

abstract = {The selection of appropriate outcomes is crucial when designing clinical trials in order to compare the effects of different interventions directly. For the findings to influence policy and practice, the outcomes need to be relevant and important to key stakeholders including patients and the public, health care professionals and others making decisions about health care. It is now widely acknowledged that insufficient attention has been paid to the choice of outcomes measured in clinical trials. Researchers are increasingly addressing this issue through the development and use of a core outcome set, an agreed standardised collection of outcomes which should be measured and reported, as a minimum, in all trials for a specific clinical area. Accumulating work in this area has identified the need for guidance on the development, implementation, evaluation and updating of core outcome sets. This Handbook, developed by the COMET Initiative, brings together current thinking and methodological research regarding those issues. We recommend a four-step process to develop a core outcome set. The aim is to update the contents of the Handbook as further research is identified.},

abstract = {A practical impediment in adaptive clinical trials is that outcomes must be observed soon enough to apply decision rules to choose treatments for new patients. For example, if outcomes take up to six weeks to evaluate and the accrual rate is one patient per week, on average three new patients will be accrued while waiting to evaluate the outcomes of the previous three patients. The question is how to treat the new patients. This logistical problem persists throughout the trial. Various ad hoc practical solutions are used, none entirely satisfactory. We focus on this problem in phase I-II clinical trials that use binary toxicity and efficacy, defined in terms of event times, to choose doses adaptively for successive cohorts. We propose a general approach to this problem that treats late-onset outcomes as missing data, uses data augmentation to impute missing outcomes from posterior predictive distributions computed from partial follow-up times and complete outcome data, and applies the design's decision rules using the completed data. We illustrate the method with two cancer trials conducted using a phase I-II design based on efficacy-toxicity trade-offs, including a computer stimulation study.},

Women who had undergone surgery to treat idiopathic intracranial hypertension were excluded.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERVENTION: Stage 1: no new intervention; stage 2: nutritionally complete low energy (calorie) diet (1777 kJ/day (425 kcal/day)); stage 3: follow-up period after the diet. Each stage lasted three months.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was reduction in intracranial pressure after the diet. Secondary measures included score on headache impact test-6, papilloedema (as measured by ultrasonography of the elevation of the optic disc and diameter of the nerve sheath, together with thickness of the peripapillary retina measured by optical coherence tomography), mean deviation of Humphrey visual field, LogMAR visual acuity, and symptoms. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline and three, six, and nine months. Lumbar puncture, to quantify intracranial pressure, was measured at baseline and three and six months.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: All variables remained stable over stage 1. During stage 2, there were significant reductions in weight (mean 15.7 (SD 8.0) kg, P{\textless}0.001), intracranial pressure (mean 8.0 (SD 4.2) cm H(2)O, P{\textless}0.001), score on headache impact test (7.6 (SD 10.1), P=0.004), and papilloedema (optic disc elevation (mean 0.15 (SD 0.23) mm, P=0.002), diameter of the nerve sheath (mean 0.7 (SD 0.8) mm, P=0.004), and thickness of the peripapillary retina (mean 25.7 (SD 36.1) micro, P=0.001)). Mean deviation of the Humphrey visual field remained stable, and in only five patients, the LogMAR visual acuity improved by one line. Fewer women reported symptoms including tinnitus, diplopia, and obscurations (10 v 4, P=0.004; 7 v 0, P=0.008; and 4 v 0, P=0.025, respectively). Re-evaluation at three months after the diet showed no significant change in weight (0.21 (SD 6.8) kg), and all outcome measures were maintained.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Women with idiopathic intracranial hypertension who followed a low energy diet for three months had significantly reduced intracranial pressure compared with pressure measured in the three months before the diet, as well as improved symptoms and reduced papilloedema. These reductions persisted for three months after they stopped the diet.},

@article{Polley2011,
abstract = {The goal of phase I cancer trials is to determine the highest dose of a treatment regimen with an acceptable toxicity rate. Traditional designs for phase I trials, such as the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) and the 3 + 3 design, require each patient or a cohort of patients to be fully evaluated for the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) before new patients can be enrolled. As such, the trial duration may be prohibitively long. The Time-to-Event Continual Reassessment Method (TITE-CRM, Cheung and Chappell, 2000) circumvents this limitation by allowing staggered patient accrual without the need for complete DLT follow-up of previously treated patients. However, in the setting of fast patient accrual and late-onset toxicities, the TITE-CRM results in overly aggressive dose escalation and exposes a considerable number of patients to toxic doses. We examine a modification to the TITE-CRM proposed by the original TITE-CRM creator and propose an alternative approach useful in this setting by incorporating an accrual suspension rule. A simulation study designed based on a neuro-oncology trial indicates that the modified methods provide a much improved degree of safety than the TITE-CRM while maintaining desirable design accuracy. The practical aspects of the proposed designs are discussed. The modifications presented are useful when planning phase I trials involving chemoradiation therapy.},

abstract = {Objectives In 2012, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence assessed dasatinib, nilotinib, and standard-dose imatinib as first-line treatment of chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Licensing of these alternative treatments was based on randomized controlled trials assessing complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months as primary end points. We use this case study to illustrate the validation of CCyR and MMR as surrogate outcomes for overall survival in CML and how this evidence was used to inform National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's recommendation on the public funding of these first-line treatments for CML. Methods We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the association between CCyR and MMR at 12 months and overall survival in patients with chronic phase CML. We estimated life expectancy by extrapolating long-term survival from the weighted overall survival stratified according to the achievement of CCyR and MMR. Results Five studies provided data on the observational association between CCyR or MMR and overall survival. Based on the pooled association between CCyR and MMR and overall survival, our modeling showed comparable predicted mean duration of survival (21-23 years) following first-line treatment with imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib. Conclusions This case study illustrates the consideration of surrogate outcome evidence in health technology assessment. Although it is often recommended that the acceptance of surrogate outcomes be based on randomized controlled trial data demonstrating an association between the treatment effect on both the surrogate outcome and the final outcome, this case study shows that policymakers may be willing to accept a lower level of evidence (i.e., observational association). ?? 2013 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).},

Typically, there is no single standard endpoint to assess the toxicity or efficacy of the compound of interest, but co-primary endpoints are available to assess the toxic effects or the working of the compound. Modeling the responses jointly is thus appealing to draw overall inferences using all responses and to capture the association among the responses.

This papers considers a model for multivariate data with hierarchically clustered and overdispersed non-Gaussian data. Gamma random effect for the over-dispersion and normal random effects for the clustering in the data are being used. The two outcomes are jointly analyzed by assuming that the normal random effects for both endpoints are correlated. The association structure between the response is analytically derived.

abstract = {Applied researchers often find themselves making statistical inferences in settings that would seem to require multiple comparisons adjustments. We challenge the Type I error paradigm that underlies these corrections. Moreover we posit that the problem of multiple comparisons can disappear entirely when viewed from a hierarchical Bayesian perspective. We propose building multilevel models in the settings where multiple comparisons arise. Multilevel models perform partial pooling (shifting estimates toward each other), whereas classical procedures typically keep the centers of intervals stationary, adjusting for multiple comparisons by making the intervals wider (or, equivalently, adjusting the {\$}p{\$}-values corresponding to intervals of fixed width). Thus, multilevel models address the multiple comparisons problem and also yield more efficient estimates, especially in settings with low group-level variation, which is where multiple comparisons are a particular concern.},

abstract = {We explored the impact of early molecular response (EMR; BCR-ABL ≤10{\%} on the international scale [BCR-ABL(IS)] at 3 or 6 months) on outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase treated with nilotinib or imatinib based on 4 years of follow up in Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in Clinical Trials-Newly Diagnosed Patients. Patients (n = 846) received nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, nilotinib 400 mg twice daily, or imatinib 400 mg once daily. At 3 months, more patients had EMR failure (ie, BCR-ABL(IS) {\textgreater}10{\%}) on imatinib (33{\%}) than on nilotinib (9{\%}-11{\%}); similarly at 6 months, 16{\%} of patients in the imatinib arm vs 3{\%} and 7{\%} in the nilotinib arms had EMR failure. In all arms, EMR failure was associated with lower rates of molecular response, an increased risk of progression, and lower overall survival compared with EMR achievement. We also analyzed patient and treatment characteristics associated with EMR and found distinct patterns in the nilotinib arms vs the imatinib arm. High Sokal risk score was associated with a high rate of EMR failure on imatinib, but not on nilotinib. In contrast, reduced dose intensity and dose interruptions were strongly associated with EMR failure in nilotinib-treated, but not imatinib-treated, patients. This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as {\#}NCT00471497.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Efficacy and toxicity are both important outcomes in cancer clinical trials. Nonetheless, most statistical designs for phase II trials only provide rules for evaluating treatment efficacy, and moreover only allow early stopping after fixed cohorts of patients have been treated. We illustrate a new statistical design strategy for monitoring both adverse and efficacy outcomes on a patient-by-patient basis in phase II and other single-arm clinical trials. DESIGN: The new strategy is used to design a phase II trial of the experimental regimen idarubicin plus cytarabine (ara-C) plus cyclosporine for treatment of patients with intermediate-prognosis acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The design requires a maximum of 56 patients and provides continuous monitoring boundaries to terminate the trial if the toxicity rate is unacceptably high or the complete remission (CR) rate is unacceptably low compared with the rates of these events with the standard regimen of anthracycline plus ara-C. RESULTS: The design has an 88{\%} to 91{\%} probability of stopping the trial early with a median of 15 to 18 patients if the toxicity rate of the experimental regimen is .05 to .10 above that of the standard and there is no improvement in the CR rate. If there is a .15 improvement in the CR rate and the toxicity rate is no more than .05 above that of the standard, then there is at least an 83{\%} probability that the trial will run to completion. CONCLUSION: The proposed monitoring strategy provides a flexible, practical means to continuously monitor both safety and efficacy in single-arm cancer clinical trials. The design strategy can be implemented easily using a freely available menu-driven computer program, and provides a scientifically sound alternative to the use of ad hoc safety monitoring rules},

abstract = {I consider seven misunderstandings that may be encountered about the nature, purpose and properties of randomisation in clinical trials. Some concern the practical realities of clinical research on patients. Others are to do with the value and purpose of balance. Still others are to do with a confusion about the role of conditioning in valid statistical inference. I consider a simple game of chance involving two dice to illustrate some points about inference and then consider the seven misunderstandings in turn. I conclude that although one should not make a fetish of randomisation, when proposing alternatives to randomisation in clinical trials, one should be very careful to be precise about the exact nature of the alternative being considered if one is to avoid the danger of underestimating the advantages that randomisation can offer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: External pilot or feasibility studies can be used to estimate key unknown parameters to inform the design of the definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT). However, there is little consensus on how large pilot studies need to be, and some suggest inflating estimates to adjust for the lack of precision when planning the definitive RCT.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We use a simulation approach to illustrate the sampling distribution of the standard deviation for continuous outcomes and the event rate for binary outcomes. We present the impact of increasing the pilot sample size on the precision and bias of these estimates, and predicted power under three realistic scenarios. We also illustrate the consequences of using a confidence interval argument to inflate estimates so the required power is achieved with a pre-specified level of confidence. We limit our attention to external pilot and feasibility studies prior to a two-parallel-balanced-group superiority RCT.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: For normally distributed outcomes, the relative gain in precision of the pooled standard deviation (SDp) is less than 10{\%} (for each five subjects added per group) once the total sample size is 70. For true proportions between 0.1 and 0.5, we find the gain in precision for each five subjects added to the pilot sample is less than 5{\%} once the sample size is 60. Adjusting the required sample sizes for the imprecision in the pilot study estimates can result in excessively large definitive RCTs and also requires a pilot sample size of 60 to 90 for the true effect sizes considered here.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We recommend that an external pilot study has at least 70 measured subjects (35 per group) when estimating the SDp for a continuous outcome. If the event rate in an intervention group needs to be estimated by the pilot then a total of 60 to 100 subjects is required. Hence if the primary outcome is binary a total of at least 120 subjects (60 in each group) may be required in the pilot trial. It is very much more efficient to use a larger pilot study, than to guard against the lack of precision by using inflated estimates.},

abstract = {Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the lmer function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The "Blueprint PD-L1 IHC Assay Comparison Project" is an industrial-academic collaborative partnership to provide information on the analytical and clinical comparability of four PD-L1 IHC assays used in clinical trials. METHODS 39 NSCLC tumors were stained with four PD-L1 IHC assays (22C3, 28-8, SP 142 and SP 263) as used in the clinical trials. Three experts in interpreting their respective assays independently evaluated the percentages of tumor and immune cells staining positive at any intensity. Clinical diagnostic performance was assessed through comparisons of patient classification, above and below a selected expression cut-off, and by agreement using various combinations of assays and cutoffs. RESULTS Analytical comparison demonstrated the percentage of PD-L1-stained tumor cells was comparable with 22C3, 28-8 and SP263 assays, while SP142 assay exhibited fewer stained tumor cells overall. The variability of immune cell staining across four assays appears to be higher than for tumor cell staining. 19/38 cases (50.0 {\%}) were classified above, 5/38 cases (13{\%}) below the selected cutoffs of all assays. For 14/38 (37{\%}) cases, different PD-L1 classification would be made depending on which assay / scoring system is used. CONCLUSION The "Blueprint PD-L1 IHC Assay Comparison Project" revealed that three of the four assays were closely aligned on tumor cell staining whilst a fourth showed consistently fewer tumor cells stained. All assays demonstrated immune cell staining, but with greater variability compared to tumor cell staining. By comparing assays and cut-offs, the study indicates that despite similar analytical performance of PD-L1 expression for three assays, interchanging assays and cut-offs will lead to "misclassification" of PD-L1 status for some patients. . More data are required to inform on the use of alternative staining assays upon which to read different specific therapy-related PD-L1 cutoffs.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate an instrument for assessment of physical disability, mainly intended for clinical settings, the Disability Rating Index (DRI). Healthy persons (n = 1092), both white and blue collar workers, and patients (n = 366) with different levels of physical capacity, were assessed. Most of the patients (n = 303) underwent rehabilitation programmes for neck/shoulder/low-back pain but some (n = 47) were arthritis patients waiting for hip or knee replacement surgery, or wheelchair patients with multiple sclerosis (n = 16). The reliability was investigated by test-retest studies, intra- and inter-rater and internal consistency studies. Five construct validity tests were carried out: a discrimination study; a converging validity test; a test for sensitivity to small alterations in health status; and two correlational validity tests. Correlation of the self-reported DRI to the actual performance in similar activities was carried out. Responsiveness was tested by correlation of the DRI before/after replacement surgery for arthritis. The test-retest correlations were 0.83-0.95 in the studies, including correlation of different versions. The intra- and inter-rater reproducibility was 0.98 and 0.99 respectively. The Kruskal-Wallis test in the discrimination study yielded p {\textless} 0.0001. More than 90{\%} of the respondents completed the questionnaire correctly. Correlation of the DRI to the Functional Status Questionnaire was 0.46. The responsiveness was excellent, p = 0.0001. The DRI proved to be a robust, practical clinical and research instrument with good responsiveness and acceptability for assessment of disability caused by impairment of common motor functions. ?? 1994.},

abstract = {Simulation studies are computer experiments which involve creating data by pseudo-random sampling. The key strength of simulation studies is the ability to understand the behaviour of statistical methods because some 'truth' is known from the pro-cess of generating the data. This allows us to consider properties of methods, such as bias. While widely used, simulation studies are often poorly designed, analysed and reported. This article outlines the rationale for using simulation studies and offers guidance for design, execution, analysis, reporting and presentation. In par-ticular, we provide: a structured approach for planning and reporting simulation studies; coherent terminology for simulation studies; guidance on coding simulation studies; a critical discussion of key performance measures and their computation; ideas on structuring tabular and graphical presentation of results; and new graphical presentations. With a view to describing current practice and identifying areas for improvement, we review 100 articles taken from Volume 34 of Statistics in Medicine which included at least one simulation study.},

abstract = {In addition to their desired anticancer effects, most cancer treatments may also cause transient toxicity, permanent organ damage, or death. A critical question in comparing an experimental treatment to a standard is how much increase in an adverse event rate is an acceptable trade-off for achieving a targeted improvement in efficacy, or vice versa. We consider settings where one may characterize patient outcome as a bivariate (efficacy, safety) variable and quantify treatment effect as a corresponding two-dimensional parameter. A set of target parameters, each representing a clinically meaningful improvement over the standard, are elicited from the physician. Each target is a two-dimensional generalization of the usual one-dimensional shift parameter. We define the alternative hypothesis in the two-dimensional effect space as the convex hull of the sets of parameters that are at least as desirable as each target point. The rejection region is obtained by shifting the alternative toward (0,0) to achieve a given type I error, with sample size computed to achieve a given power at the targets. The method is illustrated by application to two cancer chemotherapy trials.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modeling and prediction of subject accrual and event times in clinical trials has been a topic of considerable interest for important practical reasons. It has implications not only at the initial planning stage of a trial but also on its ongoing monitoring.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPURPOSE: To provide a systematic view of the recent research in the field of modeling and prediction of subject accrual and event times in clinical trials.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Two classes of methods for modeling and prediction of subject accrual are reviewed, namely, one that uses the Brownian motion and the other uses the Poisson process. Extensions of the accrual models in multicenter clinical trials are also discussed. Trials with survival endpoints require proper joint modeling of subject accrual and event/lost-to-follow-up (LTFU) times, the latter of which can be modeled either parametrically (e.g., exponential and Weibull) or nonparametrically.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Flexible stochastic models are better suited when modeling real trials that does not follow constant underlying enrollment rate. The accrual model generally improves as center-specific information is accounted for in multicenter trials. The choice between parametric and nonparametric event models can depend on confidence on the underlying event rates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLIMITATIONS: All methods reviewed in event modeling assume noninformative censoring, which cannot be tested.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We recommend using proper stochastic accrual models, in combination with flexible event time models when applicable, for modeling and prediction of subject enrollment and event times in clinical trials.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of adjuvant local irradiation on (1) disease recurrence and (2) survival rates in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). DATA SOURCES: An Ovid MEDLINE search (January 1966-May 26, 2004) was performed using the following criteria: group 1, "Merkel cell OR trabecular OR neuroendocrine skin OR APUDoma skin OR primary small cell skin OR primary undifferentiated skin OR endocrine skin OR neuroepithelial" AND group 2, "carcinoma OR tumor OR cancer" with mapping modifiers "-title, -abstract, -keyword, -subject heading." The search yielded 843 citations. STUDY SELECTION: The Ovid set was then searched using the following criteria: "surgery OR radiation OR radiotherapy," which yielded 242 discrete citations. Reports from all 242 citations were reviewed. For the remaining 601 citations, abstracts (when available) were reviewed to assess the level of relevance for potential inclusion; reports from 63 of these citations were reviewed. An additional 28 secondary references were reviewed, for a total of 333 reports. DATA EXTRACTION: The following criteria for inclusion were applied to each potential patient: (1) a histopathologic diagnosis of MCC; (2) a single, primary tumor arising on the skin, for which (3) the primary treatment was surgical excision (local excision, wide excision, or Mohs surgery) with or without the use of adjuvant irradiation (to the tumor bed); (4) following surgery, negative (clear) surgical margins were obtained; (5) during the postoperative follow-up period, disease recurrence, progression, and survival and/or duration of event-free interval was documented with (6) a minimum follow-up of 1 month. A total of 1254 patients were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Statistically significant reductions in local (hazard ratio [HR], 0.27; P {\textless} .001) and regional (HR, 0.34; P {\textless} .001) recurrence were observed among patients treated with combination therapy compared with surgery alone. Similar rates of distant metastasis were observed between treatment groups (HR, 0.79; P = .31). Overall survival rates were 87{\%} (1 year) and 49{\%} (5 years). Cause-specific survival rates were 90{\%} (1 year) and 62{\%} (5 year). In general, differences in overall (HR, 0.78; P = .16) and cause-specific (due to MCC: HR, 0.72; P = .14) survival rates between treatment groups did not reach statistical significance. A subgroup analysis that excluded single-patient case reports and studies of only 1 treatment group revealed a significant overall (HR, 0.63; P = .02) and cause-specific (HR, 0.62; P = .04) survival advantage after treatment with combination therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery plus local adjuvant irradiation was associated with significantly lower rates of local and regional recurrence of MCC than surgery alone. Prospective investigation is needed to clarify the presence of a survival benefit from combination therapy.},

@article{Eisenhauer2009,
abstract = {Background: Assessment of the change in tumour burden is an important feature of the clinical evaluation of cancer therapeutics: both tumour shrinkage (objective response) and disease progression are useful endpoints in clinical trials. Since RECIST was published in 2000, many investigators, cooperative groups, industry and government authorities have adopted these criteria in the assessment of treatment outcomes. However, a number of questions and issues have arisen which have led to the development of a revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1). Evidence for changes, summarised in separate papers in this special issue, has come from assessment of a large data warehouse ({\textgreater}6500 patients), simulation studies and literature reviews. Highlights of revised RECIST 1.1: Major changes include: Number of lesions to be assessed: based on evidence from numerous trial databases merged into a data warehouse for analysis purposes, the number of lesions required to assess tumour burden for response determination has been reduced from a maximum of 10 to a maximum of five total (and from five to two per organ, maximum). Assessment of pathological lymph nodes is now incorporated: nodes with a short axis of ≥15 mm are considered measurable and assessable as target lesions. The short axis measurement should be included in the sum of lesions in calculation of tumour response. Nodes that shrink to {\textless}10 mm short axis are considered normal. Confirmation of response is required for trials with response primary endpoint but is no longer required in randomised studies since the control arm serves as appropriate means of interpretation of data. Disease progression is clarified in several aspects: in addition to the previous definition of progression in target disease of 20{\%} increase in sum, a 5 mm absolute increase is now required as well to guard against over calling PD when the total sum is very small. Furthermore, there is guidance offered on what constitutes 'unequivocal progression' of non-measurable/non-target disease, a source of confusion in the original RECIST guideline. Finally, a section on detection of new lesions, including the interpretation of FDG-PET scan assessment is included. Imaging guidance: the revised RECIST includes a new imaging appendix with updated recommendations on the optimal anatomical assessment of lesions. Future work: A key question considered by the RECIST Working Group in developing RECIST 1.1 was whether it was appropriate to move from anatomic unidimensional assessment of tumour burden to either volumetric anatomical assessment or to functional assessment with PET or MRI. It was concluded that, at present, there is not sufficient standardisation or evidence to abandon anatomical assessment of tumour burden. The only exception to this is in the use of FDG-PET imaging as an adjunct to determination of progression. As is detailed in the final paper in this special issue, the use of these promising newer approaches requires appropriate clinical validation studies. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The independent oversight of clinical trials, which is recommended by the Medical Research Council (MRC) Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, is typically provided by an independent advisory Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and an independent executive committee, to whom the DMC makes recommendations. The detailed roles and function of this executive committee, known as the Trial Steering Committee (TSC), have not previously been studied or reviewed since those originally proposed by the MRC in 1998. METHODS An expert panel (n = 7) was convened comprising statisticians, clinicians and trial methodologists with prior TSC experience. Twelve questions about the role and responsibilities of the TSC were discussed by the panel at two full-day meetings. Each meeting was transcribed in full and the discussions were summarised. RESULTS The expert panel reached agreement on the role of the TSC, to which it was accountable, the membership, the definition of independence, and the experience and training needed. The management of ethical issues, difficult/complex situations and issues the TSC should not ask the DMC to make recommendations on were more difficult to discuss without specific examples, but support existed for further work to help share issues and to provide appropriate training for TSC members. Additional topics discussed, which had not been identified by previous work relating to the DMCs but were pertinent to the role of the TSC, included the following: review of data sharing requests, indemnity, lifespan of the TSC, general TSC administration, and the roles of both the Funder and the Sponsor. CONCLUSIONS This paper presents recommendations that will contribute to the revision and update of the MRC TSC terms of reference. Uncertainty remains in some areas due to the absence of real-life examples; future guidance on these issues would benefit from a repository of case studies. Notably, the role of a patient and public involvement (PPI) contributor was not discussed, and further work is warranted to explore the role of a PPI contributor in independent trial oversight.},

abstract = {Radotinib (IY5511HCL), a novel and selective BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown preclinical and phase 1 activity and safety in chronic myeloid leukemia. This phase 2 study investigated the efficacy and safety of radotinib in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients with resistance and/or intolerance to BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Patients received radotinib 400 mg twice daily for 12 cycles based on results from the phase 1 trial. The primary endpoint was rate of major cytogenetic response by 12 months. A total of 77 patients were enrolled. Major cytogenetic response was achieved in 50 (65{\%}; cumulative, 75{\%}) patients, including 36 (47{\%}) patients with complete cytogenetic response by 12 months. Median time to major cytogenetic response and complete cytogenetic response were 85 days and 256 days, respectively. Major cytogenetic response and complete cytogenetic response rates were similar between imatinib-resistant and imatinib-intolerant patients, but were higher in patients without BCR-ABL1 mutations. Overall and progression-free survival rates at 12 months were 96.1{\%} and 86.3{\%}, respectively. All newly-occurring or worsening grade 3/4 hematologic abnormalities included thrombocytopenia (24.7{\%}) and anemia (5.2{\%}); grade 3/4 drug-related nonhematologic adverse events included fatigue (3.9{\%}), asthenia (3.9{\%}), and nausea (2.6{\%}). The most common biochemistry abnormality was hyperbilirubinemia (grade 3/4, 23.4{\%}), and 12 of 18 cases were managed with dose modification. Study findings suggest radotinib is effective and well tolerated in chronic phase-chronic myeloid leukemia patients with resistance and/or intolerance to BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors and may represent a promising alternative for these patients.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the phase I KEYNOTE-001 study, pembrolizumab demonstrated durable antitumor activity in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We sought to characterize the relationship between pembrolizumab dose, exposure, and response to define an effective dose for these patients. METHODS: Patients received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W) (n=55), 10 mg/kg Q3W (n=238), or 10 mg/kg Q2W (n=156). Response (RECIST v1.1) was assessed every 9 weeks. The relationship between the estimated pembrolizumab area under the concentration-time curve at steady-state over 6 weeks (AUCss-6weeks) and the longitudinal change in tumor size (sum of longest diameters) was analyzed by regression and nonlinear mixed effects modeling. This model was simultaneously fit to all tumor size data, then used to simulate response rates, normalizing the trial data across dose for prognostic covariates (tumor PD-L1 expression and EGFR mutation status). The exposure-safety relationship was assessed by logistic regression of pembrolizumab AUCss-6weeks versus occurrence of adverse events of interest based on their immune etiology. RESULTS: Overall response rates were 15{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 7{\%}-28{\%}) at 2 Q3W, 25{\%} (18{\%}-33{\%}) at 10 Q3W, and 21{\%} (95{\%} CI 14{\%} to 30{\%}) at 10 Q2W. Regression analyses of percentage change from baseline in tumor size versus AUCss-6week indicated a flat relationship (regression slope P{\textgreater}0.05). Simulations showed the exposure-response relationship to be similarly flat, thus indicating that the lowest evaluated dose of 2 mg/kg Q3W to likely be at or near the efficacy plateau. Exposure-safety analysis showed the adverse event incidence to be similar among the clinically tested doses. CONCLUSIONS: No significant exposure dependency on efficacy or safety was identified for pembrolizumab across doses of 2 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg. These results support the use of a 2-mg/kg Q3W dosage in patients with previously treated, advanced NSCLC.ClinicalTrials.gov registry: NCT01295827.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: A multicenter randomized phase II trial to evaluate two treatment strategies in the first-line management of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with a performance status (PS) of 2. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were assigned to erlotinib 150 mg orally daily until progression or to carboplatin (area under the curve [AUC] 6) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m(2) day 1 every 3 weeks) for up to four cycles. Patients who experienced progression or did not tolerate or refused further chemotherapy were allowed to cross over to erlotinib. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points were response, survival, quality of life (QOL), and a retrospective molecular correlation. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were randomly assigned to erlotinib and 51 to chemotherapy. Partial responses were 2{\%} and 12{\%}, respectively. Median PFS was 1.9 months in the erlotinib arm and 3.5 months in the chemotherapy arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.45; 95{\%} CI, 0.98 to 2.15; P = .06). Median survival times were 6.5 and 9.7 months, respectively (HR = 1.73; 95{\%} CI, 1.09 to 2.73; P = .018). Patients who crossed over to erlotinib had a median survival of 14.9 months. Sex, histology, skin rash, and smoking history predicted outcome with erlotinib. Rash and diarrhea were more common with erlotinib; emesis, alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, and fatigue were more common with chemotherapy. QOL was similar between the two arms. Molecular correlation was limited by available samples. CONCLUSION: Unselected patients with advanced NSCLC and PS 2 are best treated with combination chemotherapy as first-line therapy. Erlotinib may be considered in patients selected by clinical or molecular markers.},

abstract = {Summary Background Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues reduce hepatic steatosis, concentrations of liver enzymes, and insulin resistance in murine models of fatty liver disease. These analogues are licensed for type 2 diabetes, but their efficacy in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is unknown. We assessed the safety and efficacy of the long-acting GLP-1 analogue, liraglutide, in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Methods This multicentre, double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial was conducted in four UK medical centres to assess subcutaneous injections of liraglutide (1??8 mg daily) compared with placebo for patients who are overweight and show clinical evidence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated, centrally administered procedure, stratified by trial centre and diabetes status. The trial was designed using A'Hern's single-group method, which required eight (38{\%}) of 21 successes in the liraglutide group for the effect of liraglutide to be considered clinically significant. Patients, investigators, clinical trial site staff, and pathologists were masked to treatment assignment throughout the study. The primary outcome measure was resolution of definite non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with no worsening in fibrosis from baseline to end of treatment (48 weeks), as assessed centrally by two independent pathologists. Analysis was done by intention-to-treat analysis, which included all patients who underwent end-of-treatment biopsy. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01237119. Findings Between Aug 1, 2010, and May 31, 2013, 26 patients were randomly assigned to receive liraglutide and 26 to placebo. Nine (39{\%}) of 23 patients who received liraglutide and underwent end-of-treatment liver biopsy had resolution of definite non-alcoholic steatohepatitis compared with two (9{\%}) of 22 such patients in the placebo group (relative risk 4??3 [95{\%} CI 1??0-17??7]; p=0??019). Two (9{\%}) of 23 patients in the liraglutide group versus eight (36{\%}) of 22 patients in the placebo group had progression of fibrosis (0??2 [0??1-1??0]; p=0??04). Most adverse events were grade 1 (mild) to grade 2 (moderate) in severity, transient, and similar in the two treatment groups for all organ classes and symptoms, with the exception of gastrointestinal disorders in 21 (81{\%}) of 23 patients in the liraglutide group and 17 (65{\%}) of 22 patients in the placebo group, which included diarrhoea (ten [38{\%}] patients in the liraglutide group vs five [19{\%}] in the placebo group), constipation (seven [27{\%}] vs none), and loss of appetite (eight [31{\%}] vs two [8{\%}]). Interpretation Liraglutide was safe, well tolerated, and led to histological resolution of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, warranting extensive, longer-term studies.

abstract = {The continual reassessment method as described by {\{}O'Quigley{\}}, Pepe, and Fisher (1990, Biometrics 46, 33-48) leans to a large extent upon a Bayesian methodology. Initial experimentation and sequential updating are carried out in a natural way within the context of a Bayesian framework. In this paper we argue that such a framework is easily changed to a more classic one leaning upon likelihood theory. The essential features of the continual reassessment method remain unchanged. In particular, large sample properties are the same unless the prior is degenerate. For small samples and as far as the final recommended dose level is concerned, simulations indicate that there is not much to choose between a likelihood approach and a Bayesian one. However, for in-trial allocation of dose levels to patients, there are some differences and these are discussed. In contrast to the Bayesian approach, a likelihood one requires some extra effort to get off the ground. This is because the likelihood equation has no solution until we observe a toxicity. Initially then we suggest working with either a standard Up-and-Down scheme or standard continual reassessment method until toxicity is observed and then switching to the new scheme.},

Following an initial equal randomization period, chemorefractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients were adaptively randomized to erlotinib, vandetanib, erlotinib plus bexarotene, or sorafenib, based on relevant molecular biomarkers analyzed in fresh core needle biopsy specimens. Overall results include a 46{\%} 8-week disease control rate (primary end point), confirm prespecified hypotheses, and show an impressive benefit from sorafenib among mutant-KRAS patients. BATTLE establishes the feasibility of a new paradigm for a personalized approach to lung cancer clinical trials. SIGNIFICANCE: The BATTLE study is the first completed prospective, adaptively randomized study in heavily pretreated NSCLC patients that mandated tumor profiling with "real-time" biopsies, taking a substantial step toward realizing personalized lung cancer therapy by integrating real-time molecular laboratory findings in delineating specific patient populations for individualized treatment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metronomic chemotherapy is considered an anti-angiogenic therapy that involves chronic administration of low-dose chemotherapy at regular short intervals. We investigated the optimal metronomic dose of oral vinorelbine when given as monotherapy in patients with metastatic cancer.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Patients with recurrent metastatic breast (BC), prostate (PC) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and adequate organ functions were randomly assigned to 30, 40 or 50 mg vinorelbine, taken orally three times a week. Treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or maximum 24 months. Primary endpoint was time-to-treatment failure (TTF) and secondary were progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity, changes in blood concentrations of angiogenesis-associated biomarkers and pharmacokinetics.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Seventy-three patients were enrolled. Four-month TTF rate did not differ between the three arms: 25.9{\%} (11.1{\%}-46.2{\%} 95{\%} Confidence Interval), 33.3{\%} (15.6{\%}-55.3{\%}) and 18.2{\%} (5.2{\%}-40.3{\%}) for the 30 mg, 40 mg and 50 mg arms (p-value = 0.56). Objective response was seen in 2 patients with NSCLC (treated at 30 and 50 mg respectively), one with BC (at 40 m g) and one with PC (at 50 mg) and lasted from 4 to 100 weeks, with maximum response duration achieved at 50 mg. Adverse events were mild and negligible and did not differ between the three arms. Blood levels of vinorelbine reached steady state from the second week of treatment and mean values for the 30, 40 and 50 mg were respectively 1.8 ng/ml (SD 1.10), 2.2 ng/ml (SD 1.87) and 2.6 ng/ml (SD 0.69). Low pre-treatment blood concentrations of FGF2 and IL8 predicted favorable response to therapy (p values 0.02 and 0.006, respectively), while high levels of TEK gene transcript predicted treatment resistance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Considering the antitumor activity and response duration, the negligible toxicity of the highest dose investigated and the lack of drug accumulation over time, we suggest that 50 mg given three times a week is the optimal dose for metronomic oral vinorelbine. Further investigation of metronomic oral vinorelbine (MOVIN) at this dose is warranted in combination with conventional chemotherapy regimens and targeted therapies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00278070.},

abstract = {The benefits and challenges of incorporating biomarkers into the development of anticancer agents have been increasingly discussed. In many cases, a sensitive subpopulation of patients is determined based on preclinical data and/or by retrospectively analyzing clinical trial data. Prospective exploration of sensitive subpopulations of patients may enable us to efficiently develop definitively effective treatments, resulting in accelerated drug development and a reduction in development costs. We consider the development of a new molecular-targeted treatment in cancer patients. Given preliminary but promising efficacy data observed in a phase I study, it may be worth designing a phase II clinical trial that aims to identify a sensitive subpopulation. In order to achieve this goal, we propose a Bayesian randomized phase II clinical trial design incorporating a biomarker that is measured on a graded scale. We compare two Bayesian methods, one based on subgroup analysis and the other on a regression model, to analyze a time-to-event endpoint such as progression-free survival (PFS) time. The two methods basically estimate Bayesian posterior probabilities of PFS hazard ratios in biomarker subgroups. Extensive simulation studies evaluate these methods' operating characteristics, including the correct identification probabilities of the desired subpopulation under a wide range of clinical scenarios. We also examine the impact of subgroup population proportions on the methods' operating characteristics. Although both methods' performance depends on the distribution of treatment effect and the population proportions across patient subgroups, the regression-based method shows more favorable operating characteristics.
