# trialr - Clinical Trial Designs in R & Stan

This R package implements clinical trial designs in R and RStan. 

RStan is the R connector of the [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) project. Stan offers full Bayesian statistical inference so the designs implemented here tend to be Bayesian in nature. Furthermore, there is a preponderance of early-phase clinical trial designs because a) these are the designs that tend to use Bayesian methodology; and b) this is my research area.

Functions are provided to invoke a trial analysis on observed outcomes and perform simulations.

Trial designs currently implemented include:

- EffTox, by Thall &amp; Cook. 
- a Hierarchical Bayesian model for binary response outcomes, by Thall, Wathen, Bekele, Champlin, Baker & Benjamin (2003)
- Bayesian Evaluation of Bivariate Binary Outcomes with Predictive Information (BEBOP), by Brock et al.

## Usage

```{r}
library(trialr)
```

### EffTox example

In a nutshell, Thall & Cook's EffTox is a dose-finding design that uses binary efficacy and toxicity outcomes to select a dose with a high utility score. Refer to _Dose-Finding Based on Efficacy-Toxicity Trade-Offs_ (Thall & Cook) and _Effective sample size for computing prior hyperparameters in Bayesian phase I-II dose-finding_ (Thall, Herrick, Nguyen, Venier & Norris).

Get parameters for EffTox demo scenario

```{r}
dat <- efftox_parameters_demo()
```

Add outcomes for 3 patients: patient 1, treated at dose 1, has neither efficacy nor toxicity; patient 2, treated at dose 2, has just efficacy; and patients 3, treated at dose 3,  has both.

```{r}
dat$num_patients <- 3
dat$eff <- c(0, 1, 1)
dat$tox <- c(0, 0, 1)
dat$doses <- c(1, 2, 3)
```

Invoke RStan posterior sampling on model and data. By installing `trialr`, the EffTox model is compiled on your system and made available for sampling via the `stanmodels` object.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
samp <- rstan::sampling(stanmodels$EffTox, data = dat)
decision <- efftox_process(dat, samp)
decision$recommended_dose  # 3 is the recommended dose-level
round(decision$utility, 2)  #  -0.63  0.04  0.22 -0.07 -0.21
```

Doses 3 has the highest utility score. Sometimes, doses other than the maximal-utility dose will be recommended because of the dose-admissibility rules. See the papers for details. 

Functions are provided to create useful plots. 
For instance, it is illuminating to plot the posterior means of the probabilities of efficacy and toxicity at each of the doses on the trade-off contours.
The five doses are shown in red. Doses closer to the lower-right corner have higher utility. 

```{r}
efftox_contour_plot(dat, prob_eff = decision$prob_eff, prob_tox = decision$prob_tox)
title('EffTox utility contours')
```

Another way of viewing dose-utility is a density plot

`efftox_utility_density_plot(samp, doses = 1:3) + ggtitle("EffTox dose utility densities")`

*plot not shown in CRAN version of README. View at https://github.com/brockk/trialr *


From this plot, it is perhaps not obvious that dose 3 has higher expected utility than dose 2. 


## Install `trialr`


### Latest Release
To install the most recent release on CRAN, use

```{r}
install.packages("trialr")
```

### Development Version
You can install straight from GitHub and get the most recent commits (i.e. between releases).

Install devtools if you do not already have it

```{r}
if (!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
```

Then run

```{r}
devtools::install_github('brockk/trialr')
```

## Trouble-shooting
The install process is sometimes a little tricky.
`trialr` relies on Stan, so `rstan` must be installed succesfully first. 
RStan relies on a C++ compiler being installed, and the compiler used varies by platform.
I give more detailed steps for Windows, Mac and Linux below.

### Windows

In my experience, the install sequence that works best is:

1. Install `Rtools`, to get a C++ compiler
2. Install `rstan`
3. Install `trialr`

#### Installing Rtools

Visit https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/ and install for your version of R. 
I always try to use the newest version of everything to maximise chances that bugs have been fixed.

#### Installing rstan

This may be as simple as running 

```{r}
install.packages("rstan")
```

This should install the many requisites for RStan too. 
Requirements include `stantools` and `Rcpp`. 
If you encounter problems, you should visit the [RStan quick start guide](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started) and follow the instructions for your platform. 
Further help will be available at the RStan homepage at [mc-stan.org](http://mc-stan.org/interfaces/rstan.html).

Finally, install `trialr` using one of the methods described above.


### Mac
To compile C++ code on your Mac, you will need a toolchain.
One way to do that is to install the XCode developer tools.
Try running `gcc` on the command line.
If developer tools are not installed, this command should start the process.
You may need to agree to terms of use (also via the command line) before compiling is possible. 

Once a C++ compiler is installed, follow the instructions above to install `rstan`.

And finally, install `trialr` as described above.


### Linux
Coming soon.
